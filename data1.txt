in honor of an upcoming trip to vegas i thought i'd review some of my most and least favorite places in the town
this place tops the least favorite list by a long shot
hey maybe i'm just not the crowd this place is looking for
i thought i would be because i'm a huge country music fan and even admit to a grudging appreciation of liking for toby keith's music
which is good because you can't look around the bar without seeing a zillion pictures of the guy
so if you disagree with his right wing views and occasionally racist song lyrics this probably isn't the place for you
however if you like paying 8 for an aluminum bottle of bud light this is definitely the place for you
i'd question your intelligence because cheaper or free beer is readily available in las vegas but hey
if you like artery hardening fried food that claims to be southern by virtue of its being fried this is definitely the place for you
have at it
grudgingly i have to admit that the fried mac and cheese was pretty tasty if i recall correctly
what is the point of calling in an order when you arrive and they don't even have your order in the system called in my order at 12 16 pm
i arrived 15 minutes later and they didn't even have my order
waited for them to make me a new pizza which i finally got at 12 49 pm
meanwhile the whole time i had to listen to the girl at the counter scream to her fellow employees for more pizzas sauce cups and pizza labels
is the price worth it
if i could give this place less than a star i would
this was hands down one of the worst experiences i've had at a restaurant
walking in we were greeted right away and sat right away
after being seated we had to wait about 15 minutes until we were even looked at by anyone
finally we were approached by our waiter who said he would be with us in a few minutes
what the fifteen minute wait wasn't bad enough when he finally came bakc we ordered our drinks
we all got alcoholic drinks and i also asked for some tap water to go alone with my meal
upon returning he brought back water in a glass bottle
now i've been to restaurants before where they put their tap water in glass bottles to make it look more fancy so i thought that's what this restaurant did too
wrong
after seeing a couple tables next to us with just regular cups of water we flagged down our waiter to ask if this was the tap water we had asked for
he said no and that they charged for each bottle
we asked how much it was for each bottle and he said he didn't know and would go find out
there were two things wrong with this situation 1
how the hell do you not know how much a bottle of water costs as a server you should know your menu inside and out
2
it took him fifteen minutes to get back to us with a price which meant we went fifteen minutes without anything to drink because we had all finished our drinks as well as the water
0 stars for service
as for the food bleh
everything was salty and overcooked
they came by our table at least fifteen times with sausage but we were only offered their beef items a few times
as for their salad bar they had a lot of choices but none of them really worth while
i will say that their chimichurri sauce was pretty good
actually it was the highlight of the meal
it was the only thing that was actually good
i would never set foot in this place again
horrible service and sub par food
you are better off going to fogo de chao or texas de brazil
we visited this place twice while in vegas
first time for dinner it was horrible the steak was very fatty and grisly
the service also bad
we came back the next morning to try the breakfast it was just as bad the eggs were not cooked as asked the sausage was just nasty and the service was even worse this morning
so totally over this place seriously
i never know how much i'm going to pay for my meal which is the exact same meal i order every time
but tonight was the last straw when the cashier short thin hispanic lady totally copped an attitude with me about my vegetarian nacho order
she was like you only get beans or rice not both
i hope corporate can take notice and rectify this situation soon because i really enjoyed their food
until then won't be coming back
bartender was very rude when we went to place a to go order for breakfast before the outside window opened at 11am
the hostess instructed us to place the order at the bar
i asked the bartender if we could place an order and he said he couldn't stop and wait all day for us to place an order
i told him we were ready
unsure why he was so mean to us from the start
they also would not allow us to sit at a table in the dining area to wait for our food
hostess said it was for dine in customers only
there is no waiting area or seating if you are waiting for a table to open up as a dine in customer or anywhere to sit inside for those waiting for to go orders before the outside walk up window opens at 11am
none of the staff were very friendly in any of their communications to us
and the bartender was down right nasty to us
i see a lot of reviews regarding kids
this place is casual enough for kids but they do not have or offer high chairs to customers that have small children
definitely will not be coming back here ever again the type of people that come here make the buffet worse than it is when in line to pay this rude black lady was talking to me like i didn't speak english
i may be asian but i definitely know how to speak english
i told her that just because we pay sooner and squish does not mean we will get seated faster because there was already a line backed up for the people waiting to be seated
i was not even rude
i was just letting the lady know
i'm sorry but i think that a 65 year old man cussing out a 19 year old girl is just ridiculous
completely classless then after we sat down the seats were dirty with food all over we had to ask our waiter to clean it off and all he did was get a towel and brush the food to the floor
when we got our food mannnn
i wish we hadn't have paid
there was barely any food
i grabbed things that looked good but after they entered my mouth they didn't enter again
basically ended up eating 3 pieces of food and then went straight for the cotton candy because i was done for the night
another family sat next to us
while walking to their table you could totally tell the son was drunk
after awhile we definitely watched him throw up on the table then leave
needless to say disgusting
never again
they do not attract the right people
well i've finally eaten here and i must say
what is all the fuss about these burgers are terrible very uninspiring and bland
burger king has better butgers oh and the fries
just as bad
worst tacos ever
makes me sad
in la
there are better places in skid row
people
stop giving these people your money these are not good at all
our waitress was fine but that is the only positive thing i can say
i ordered the filet mignon merlot cooked medium
it was much closer to medium rare
i really don't mind a medium rare steak but i had to saw through it with my knife
it was a bit chewy
it did not melt in my mouth like it should have
i've honestly had better steaks at outback
the frites that came with the steak were horribly inconsistent some of them were slightly soft while others were very dark crunchy and overcooked
a lot of the frites had black spots in the potato
it took the serving crew about 5 minutes to figure out which plate was supposed to be served to which guest at my table
maybe the place was just having a bad night but i can't recommend this place and will not return
very disappointed after reading the review journal write up today
it's under cookies might be too good to be true red velvet claims there cookies are 27 cal each
come to find out they were tested and they are 157cal per cookie
i was referred by a friend and also referred many people to red velvet
i can't believe i was paying 6
00 for a pack of cookies claiming to be 162 cal total and they were 942 cal and paying 1
00 a cookie i've spent hundreds of dollars at this establishment and i'm sure there are many other people who have also
i even sent these desserts to my mother in law who is a diabetic
i really hope there is a furthur investigaion
i can't imagine how bad the rest of the food is
people go here and spend a lot of money thinking they are getting low calorie healthy diabetic friendy food and instead your getting scammed
yuckity yuck the banchan were half rotten nothing looked like the pictures
everything tasted like it was compensated by msg for flavor
went out of our way because of it's stars these stars must have been given by family friends and employees
i went their two times and could not place my order cuz the guys behind the counter were too busy flirting with the chicks
lol will not go back again
trash
the service is slower then molasses and when they mess up an order they wont want to compensate for you their mistake
mind blowing i know
stay clear of this location
it's a cold 43 degrees outside today and it's just as cold in the restaurant i'm not exaggerating would it kill them to turn on the heat a bit for their customers ordered their pho with everything in it and a side of spring rolls
spring rolls came out and it was right out of the refrigerator cold as in pre made
then the pho came out with the add in veggie only sprouts basil and 1 lime wedge bare minimum stuff
the broth was flat with very little flavor
i reached for the sauces and the bottles were dirty with dried sauce around the spout
and to top it off after the meal i was super thirsty so i'm figuring too much msg
in conclusion it wasn't a good deal at all i won't be returning
this place was good the first time around but the service is super slow and one of the ladies decided to change the trash hand me my food and not wash her hands
after today i will never eat here again
can i give half a star this was quite shocking actually especially for a big name restaurant bar in vegas
first issue seated ourselves in the bar
no one approached us a manager did walk past us after 12 min my husband got up asked the hostess if there was a cocktail service she responded yes pointed to a girl talking to friends at the bar
we did finally get our drinks delivered by the manager who walked past us 20 min earlier
which was nice however we took our business to the d and enjoyed cocktails with napkins olives appetizers and the best service ever from ali the bartender adiamo's
first time i've been disappointed here
service was slow no utensil no condiments waited forever for check
terrible experience
the 44 11oz lobster tail turned out to be 3 ounces and so tough we sent it back
we ordered prime rib and were unable to cut it with a steak knife
what has happened to this superb steakhouse just 2 months ago the food was delicious but like other santa fe restaurants the quality of the food has declined significantly
has there been a change in ownership or management don't waste your time dining here
i was starving on a sunday night and everything else at ti was closed
so this place was my only option
the night before i had a carrot cake from here
it was alright but i expected something better for a 7 carrot cake
the desserts at the aria and bellagio brunch buffet tasted much better than the carrot cake
anyways i ordered a french onion soup and my boyfriend order a mango smoothie
it took half an hour for the soup to come out and they still did not bring out the mango smoothie
my boyfriend asked to cancel the smoothie and the waiter said it is done we are looking for a glass for it
my boyfriend and i were confused
is it that hard to get a glass in a casino where drinks are served everywhere one star for the french onion soup
it was okay a little bit too salty though
do not eat here customer service is terrible
the meatballs i ordered came out cold and when i tried to send them back
the owner had the audacity to argue with me about nothing being wrong with them
he even said i'll take them back but you'll still be charged for them also noticed a bit of uneasiness being i was the only african american in the place at the time
i just had the worse experience from this place
it's not the food but the customer service of this popolo guy
he is very rude and no aloha at all
i don't think so
wendys went there earlier today the cashier had bad customer service
you guys should hire friendly employees
definitely not coming here any more
awful there were so many things wrong with this place i can't count
ordered the ribs sauce on the side
and the kitchen thought that meant extra sauce on the side
they weren't bad ribs
nice if you like something plain
we also got a cheeseburger which came without french fries and no taste i was shocked that the title dish was so bad
the waitress was walking around and asked how my burger was
i said it had no taste and she said sorry to hear that and walked away
i can't imagine this place getting repeat business
we will not be returning
signage days open daily and hours says 11 30 10
went today sunday may 3 at 435 and they were closed
came on yelp and says opens in 20 mins
they need to change their signage
i went there for dinner around 6 on a monday night
the line wasn't as long as i expected and it moved quickly
we were seated within 10 minutes
anyhow the meal was a huge disappointment
i was expecting great quality food after reading the reviews on yelp and trip advisor
at first i was a bit overwhelmed with the selection but after walking around several times and narrowing down what seemed appetizing there wasn't much to choose from
the salad bar was a joke with few selections of veggies and mainly green leaves
i got prime rib cold and tough kobe sirloin tough and tasteless pesto mashed potato probably the only yummy side i could eat something that looked like beef stew tender and flavorful and but too cold creme brue le gross
the inside was watering rotisserie chicken cold and bland crab legs i could only wish it was served steam instead cold
argh
bottom line i wish there was a microwave to heat up my food
ok i like new places but should have known that if it close to unlv it caters to college students
two of my children in their 20's along with my wife and a newborn granddaughter checked this place out on a monday morning around 10 am they open at 10 am
the total for this visit 47
97
i check out the facilities before eating to just wash my hands and get an over view of everything
the restroom was very dirty especially the corners and the walls i won't describe it was just bad
they do have a sign indicating they want to be notified if the restrooms are dirty but who are you really going to tell with one person talking orders a line of people in front of her and no one else within eye sight
i liked everything i ordered the fires are salted with sea salt i should have asked for no salt
they were very salty my wife didn't care for the grilled onion on her burger and the haystack fries tasted like a squirt of grease with every bite
my son in law loved every bite my daughter said she loved it all but i tasted her smash fries and i didn't care for the herbs and spray of olive oil on them
our granddaughter sleeps through it all yes
they offer fry sauce it has a horsey radish taste to it not for me
basically my wife and didn't care for this new restaurant and our children loved it
for the money i could think of a lot of other places to eat lunch
never again
used to love to come here with local friends for the ayce option
quality was about average compared to other ayce but very convenient being in silverado ranch area
was very disappointed to find out that they pulled their ayce menu
combo options have the same quality food at about 2 3x the price
a la carte options are good but not worth the price
i'll head to doh on rainbow windmill for my fix now way better food and well worth the extra drive
had dinner here with a large party for a friend's bachelorette weekend extravaganza
i'm glad i was in good company because this place was a joke
i don't think my gf got the memo of how bootsy this place is
there are countless of other places we could've gone to anywhere that didn't have skulls neon voodoo crap entering this place felt like going into a scary ride a theme park
the place was dead
literally
there was no one there
and mind you the men in black the door wouldn't let some people in wtf after dinner the smart ones who drank most of the witch's brew it was huge was lucky enough not to remember the awful dining experience
i should've known better got wasted like the rest of them
was too busy trying to dodge corners thinking the grim reaper was coming after me
no no wasn't on hallucinogens either
haha did i mention that the brew had dry ice the food umm
forgettable
i seriously don't remember
and me not remembering food must have been that bad
someone needs to do something witht his place
this is prime realty being wasted
we're talking major overhaul to be up to par with the rest of the city
i get the whole theme but i still say don't do it
unless of course you're into that kind of stuff
you'd see a better view of the strip from the ghost bar palms across the way
ironic that it sounds voodoo ey but it's not at all
every other place we went to after that made up for this crappy resto lounge so i'm not that bitter
i mean it's vegas how mad could you be seriously though if you find yourself stuck the rio you'll be better off taking your money partying with the seafood at the buffet downstairs
lmfao
ok
fine
1
1 that's my final rating
cute little place place was packed so i had high hopes
wrong
started with the mongolian pancakes
took one bite and had about 3 tablespoons of grease spilled out onto my plate
yuck next we had the pork mushroom noodles some sort of knife sliced beef soup and a chow mien
all were just about inedible so salty i can't even describe it oh and fyi
no refills on the tea
my buddy and i went to miller's alehouse today for lunch right next frys electronics and wow food was terrible
we were both disappointed in their food quality
it actually gave me a stomach ache
the service was good but they still don't deserve any stars
we are not going back here again
horrible customer service had to ask other waitresses for items
the mixed drinks taste like virgins the beers come in plastic cups
food came out cold the best part of the meal was the fried pickles and fries
i have went to hooters in arizona multiple times and was by far the worst i'm not impressed what so ever thought it'd of been one of the best around
do yourself a favor go else where for a meal
00 on anything else
if you are looking for a good asian buffet
don't go here
everything was dried up from the rice to the bloody chicken
i tried the barbecue chicken on a skewer and when taking a bite it was like trying to rip off a piece of rubber with my teeth
i spent the rest of my day frequently using the restroom
are you people kidding me the place should be shut down unsafe tempretures on the food nothing was hot
homeless people in clear view of my table bumming cigs off anyone entering the place
they are also pushy when they bring your bill half way through your meal
they seemed upset that we used credit instead of cash
i've noticed that many asian shops dont like that
bottom line is stay away from any restaurants that are located in wall mart shopping centers
simple way overpriced small portions and worst of all as i was paying my bill 12 for sm pastrami n sm drink
roaches scurrying on the counter
unfortunately for me i had eaten but for u still a chance lol
booooooooooooo just found out that they took out lucky 7s and replaced it with some bs
it's 11
80 now
f that
waited at the bar for a half hour for a table which wasn't a problem cause the drinks were good
finally got a table but the server was very rude
i simply asked what's good here he replied with the carnitas and walked away
thankfully we got chips and salsa for the half hour wait for the food only for the server to come back over and tell one of us they were out of tamales and said what else you want after that we decided to leave
i've worked in restaurants for a while and chose not to pay a penny for our experience
i'm sure if we had another server we would have enjoyed everything but def won't be returning
horrible place if you want to grab a fast lunch
i was on my break and another friend was going to meet me
due to my limited time they would not sit me to start eating while i waited for my friend
very inconvenient
this is the only poor performer in the wynn
every casino has a 24 hour restaurant where you should be able to get a reasonably priced plate of eggs at a odd time
the first time we came they had at least half of their tables open but would not seat us
we left
we came back at 7am and they took 30 minutes to make breakfast dishes when we were the only ones in the restaurant
i know the wynn is known for it's fine dining so their corned beef hash should be the best i've ever tasted
and for 12 it really wasn't
did someone put lemon juice in it
i went in to xo chinese food w an open mind
was and craving a quick bite to eat
i had tried other chinese food restaurants nearby jacky chans wtpho i ordered my go o chinese dish of general tso chicken
i told the man working as the cashier that it was dine in
after waiting awhile a woman emerged with my to go order all bagged and tied up in a plastic bag
i told her i was eating there and she looked surprised
after opening the bag and container of food and trying the chicken which was hard and looked old like they had some leftover chicken and dumped sauce on it
everything was dry and old
the food looked absolutely nothing like what was pictured on the menu on the wall
not sure if i'll ever go back
the server helped herself to choose her tip on my credit card
the manager thought he was a hero by offering me the stolen money back and 5
00 additional for my i'm sorry for your loss gift
after i let him know that 5
00 was not acceptable it was raised to 15
00
i received the gift card in the mail and once again called them to let them know my disappointment
well they supposedly sent out another 40
00 gift card which together is still less than my meal that night
awful customer relations
unless i called them i never got a call from customer relations or the management of the restaurant
a restaurant to skip for sure
this was a last resort effort to get good italian food near my house
i was very dissappointed
the calamari were just big rings fried to a level that it felt like i was eating a tire
the pizza was very unappetizing as well
putting a restaurant in a bar might not be the best idea after all
i also tried the tortellini hoping upon hope that it would be made with panna piseli prosciutto or panceta and parmeggiano cheese mixed into the sauce
their version of this was defrosted tortellini immersed in a similar cheese sauce they put on an arby's beef cheddar
not conducive to a proper pasta dish
maybe if we give them some time to figure things out the place might be able to get a following
they've already lost this one
the food was great but the service was horrible
after being seated our order was taken within 5 min of sitting down
probably because we all had our menus shut due to the fact that we had a lot of time to look at it while waiting for a table 1hr and 44 min
this wait made no sense at all
there were hardly any people seated and i would said 90 of the tables were empty but had not been cleaned from other people who already finished eating and left
it started off as fast service when once we were seated
then it went down hill from there
30 min until our drinks came out
literally took 1 hour and 20 min to get our food for 2 people only what about the other two in our party 30 minutes later the other 2 entrees were served
not only that it took over an hour for food but the food didn't come out at one time
this was bad
i finished my coconut water 30 minutes before the food came out and asked if their were refills
i was told no
fine i'll take that but i was hoping i would be able to enjoy my drink with my food
half of us were done eating before the other half got their food
i would have rather them just keep the two entrees that were done and serve all 4 of us at the same time
this made no sense
next time i'll just order for pick up
if i do go back
the worst experience of my life
the food was horrible the bad service too
i do not recommend
very unsatisfied ordered for delivery and yes i was informed it would take about an hour
i kid you not 2 hrs later my food arrived and not only was it cold it was spilled all over inside the bag
called to speak with someone and it went to answering machine
not happy
never again
two friends and i decided last minute to try this place
we walked in around 7pm and the restaurant was not busy
even so we weren't even greeted
after awkwardly standing around for 15 minutes waiting for the hostess she finally wrote us down on her computer and told us it would be 15 minute wait to be seated
we sat in the lobby area about 20 minutes
finally seated our server seemed a little out of it
he had no energy
we ordered two shrimp fresca pastas and tenderloin tips
we were given a plate of plain bread with no butter
so we asked for some butter the server apparently forgot and we had to ask a second time for butter
after about 35 minutes of waiting our food came out
unfortunately both dishes were not good
the shrimp fresca pasta was overly greasy and too salty
the tenderloin tips were too chewy and must not have been prepared correctly because my friend ended up with an upset stomach that night
we were not happy with the service we received
wait time service and taste were all a disappointment
it doesn't seem like any of the workers enjoyed working there nobody smiled
i will not be dining at claim jumpers ever again
your only as good as your last meal
well this is our last meal at kfc
over 30 for 12 pieces of chicken and 3 sides
the sides were great
customer service was slow and a little on the rude side
we asked if we could get legs and wings since the meal was mainly for our kids and we were told no problem
i have to learn to check orders before we leave but i don't understand why we have to
if we told them what we wanted and they put it on the receipt then why can't the order get right
it was not just original in the container and it also had thighs and breasts
my kids were not happy
we also ordered this with mashed potatoes cole slaw which was dry and the potato wedges
no potato wedges but instead another mashed potatoes and gravy
didn't want to go back and deal with the poor customer service
kfc seems to be really loosing the quality of product
seems like that is happening across the board
maybe it is time to bring back the mom and pop restaurants
oliver wiped down my chair with filthy rag didn't tell me i sat down and whole back of my top was wet and smelly
very unprofessional
terrible i walked in at 7pm to music blasting and stood at the counter for five minutes before yelling hello still no one came
as i was walking out the door then someone came around
someone needs to teach these people how to be professional
this is the worst tropical smoothie store i have ever been in this review is on service or lack of as i did not get a smoothie
terrible terrible terrible made am 8pm reservation for my birthday
my boyfriend actually made it for us when he called he let them know it was my birthday and requested a seat outside so we can see the water and watch the mini show
they said they would put the request in and let us know when we arrived
which we totally understood
called at 7 40pm to let them know we were going to be like 10minutes late
they said not a problem thanks for calling arrived at 8 10pm
needless to say got up and left
no way to celebrate a birthday
very disappointed
the wynn and encore say they strive for 5 star success and that was no where near 5 star
crappy time
not worth the price at all you don't charge 35 for a buffet without sashimi chicken taste like rock king crab legs taste like over night socks you know why they charge you at outside before you come in you will run away after looking at their food
i went here when i first landed and wanted to gab a quick breakfast by myself
i ordered oj the 3 eggs with sausage and toast which was 25
never saw my server again until it was time to pay which was an issue considering they brought me dry toast with no jam or butter
i mean its one thing if i order the toast dry but for 25 you better have a huge selection of jams for me to choose from i decided not to eat my toasted bread
i waited 20 mins for them to run my credit card and only when the server was dropping it off did he pretend to be interested in where i flew in from and why i was in vegas obviously trying to get a better tip
i overheard a group talking about going in as i was leaving and told them how underwhelming the experience was and i saw them walk to another place
wish someone would have done the same for me
do not eat here this was the worst dining experience i've had in my life
the food took over a half hour and it was cold when we got it
when i complained to the manager craig schneider he condescendingly said this isn't a fast food restaurant twice what a jerk 12 for a burger patty with a slice of cheese and bread with no fries
this place is not even worth looking at the menu
i'd give zero stars if possible
they totally lied to me i called ahead to confirm the game with sound on and was assured oh yes that's an important game no problem then i had to beg to get the usa honduras match a critical worldcup qualifier on the tv
then they played rock roll loud no tv sound
then they said at kickoff the sound will be on so never heard the pre game discussion
and then tv sound never happened
and they were rude when i politely pressed them about it
they suck
don't ever expect a warm soccer environment there it's all about something else and they treat you with contempt
us soccer should condemn them
i will keep this short
this has to be the worst restaurant on the strip
just because there is a famous name on the door doesn't mean they know everything
however the waiter we had thought he was the god of fine dining
this is the most pretentious and deceptive restaurant i have been to
going here you know you're going to spend a lot no big deal
but to spend that and get the worst service is unacceptable
and of course nobody in the place cares because they have gratuity already added for large parties
steak was good but everything else ruins this place
go down the hall to delmonico and treat yourself to a great experience
if for some reason you decide to still try this place and your waiter introduces himself and his name is gary run as fast as you can
health department will be contacted tomorrow worst customer service ever been here 4 times and every time they drop our cheese or meat into the trash and pick it up and put it back on our sandwich
can't ever get ahold of the manager
she doesn't ever call back
tried calling 4 times today and they keep hanging up
i've called corporate office on another store and they don't do anything
i used to love subway but i guess i will take our money else where
can't get good customer service anymore
employees are rude and food is hella nasty
i ordered nearly 50 worth of food
it was for my son's birthday
it took over an hour for delivery to arrive and then they did not even deliver it to my door
i had to go down 3 stories and pick it up from the parking lot and still tipped the driver 7
00
every single item was inedible
some was undercooked
some was burned
all of it was awful
i immediately called to complain not my usual and found oitbtjat it was routed through a call center in alaska
i finally reached the location after being hung up on several times
i was told they could not refund my card so i informed them i had paid in cash
i was told i would receive my money back
food is completely uneaten and waiting to be picked up when the owner calls me and informs me he refuses to refund me and offers me a free pizza
do not order fron this place it is disgusting and someone will end up sick as a result
i'll never see my money but maybe i can save you some
my husband and i frequent the one in nyc on 7th and it is wonderful
this franchise in caesars was absolutely horrible
i ordered the corned beef hash and it looked like a rat had taken a dump on my plate
we took a picture of it and took it to ny and they were quite disguested at how someone could allow this to be served
the wait staff was less than accomodating we had heard from the area shops was normal so we just left
no tip nothing
will never dine here again
their nickname was the rat deli
thank goodness they were closed down
i went there for lunch
the place was pretty quiet
the waitress passed by me 3 times never said hi
i finally just left
let's start with good
they make a good margarita
however all four of us asked for salted margaritas not one of them had salt
food was tasty nothing special or memorable
i've been living in vegas for about three months now at a hotel while here on a contract as such i've become very familiar with the food offerings along the strip
now on to the review
the disappointing took forever to get a server at our table we had to flag them down after 2 water refills
see salt comment above are laughable small they arrived and we ordered another appetizer for the table
tapas sizing pricing
definitely not good value
additional appetizer never arrived it was apparently delivered to the table next to us
server tried to convince us to order more
check please i realize we're on the strip however most places even at strip prices offer good value for the amount of food
this place nope nada niet nee non
if this was the last place to eat on the strip i would probably choose to starve
my recommendation have reservations serious reservations about eating here and go elsewhere
gnaw your own arm if it comes to it
disappointed the price and quality of the food are not on par i was looking forward to the fries they were extremely hard almost stale the pastrami burger was loaded with meat and it was bland the hype is not all it's but up to be
my room wasn't available even though i booked it 3 months ahead of time
they gave us a smoking room instead and if we wanted something else it would have been extra money per night
when we got into the room it wasn't that clean the sheets had a couple stains on them there wasn't a refrigerator nor was there a microwave
when i called and asked about it they gave me major attitude and snapped at me even though i made sure to be polite and nice when speaking regardless that i was upset
the sink didn't drain and neither did the bath tub
it seems like we got the last room available because it was on the far end of the hotel and was the very last one at the end of a really long smelly hallway
called house keeping for more towels and soap never received them
for two nights and three days it was only 124 which isn't too bad
you get what you pay for i guess
my experience at this location was far from satisfactory
i placed my order at the window with anabel waited maybe 5 minutes for her to take the money for the order
after about a 15 minute wait in in the drive thru i finally got my food
i get home and take a bite only to realize almost all of the toppings were missing from my burger
thanks for the lettuce and turkey patty but where's the thousand island dressing pickles and onions i ordered so i call and the lady in the kitchen says i got what i ordered
i drove back for my refund and had to write on my receipt as to why i wanted my money back i will never return
there was no apology no offer to fix things poor customer service and no responsibility taken
last night i was driving home at approximately 1 30 am being tired hungry and having just had a confusing conversation with a girl but hey what conversation with a girl isn't confusing so clearly my judgement was a little clouded
but i decided to stop in to put 1
50 of my hard earned skrilla to good use to the tune of 10 chicken nuggets with some bbq sauce
when i arrived home i threw on the amazing race season 5 and resumed watching where i had left off while double hell sometimes even triple dipping my nuggs in the aforementioned sauce
all was well
or so i thought
i then woke up disoriented on the couch about 6 am feeling like my stomach had suddenly reached the furthermost depths of pain and discomfort
i felt sick
i was sure i was food poisoned
all i could taste was the nugget remnants mixed with the taste of the vomit i was sure i was about to spew everywhere
although i stayed by the toilet feeling miserable for over half an hour i somehow made a miraculous recovery and avoided puking and was able to fall back asleep
it was like a sign from god a warning
no more bk
so next time you get the craving to have it your way unless your way is lying on a bathroom floor at 6 am with your head on the toilet asking the good lord to just take you remember this tale and heed my warning
it's never worth it
this place charges 18 for 3 people they should tell us before time but i am willing to pay but they should tell us before time
i recently booked a suit at this hotel based at what the pictures on line look
total fake
ones we got there the rooms were nothing like the pictures
they were horrible
they looked like a crack house hotel
stains on the walls broken parts stained couches people smoking weed in elevators and bumbs hanging on the street
i recommend never stay here worst place ever
my group of 14 had the worst experience here
the staff kept threatening to kick out various people in our group for the most absurd reasons
they threatened to kick out one of my friends for putting on sunscreen
no joke
another friend got threatened when she told the bartender there was too much sweet and sour in her drink
then when i was up at the front of the dj area dancing and security asked me to step aside so a vip person could take my place
wtf
then i complained to the manager who said my boyfriend and i could go backstage
once he left another security person threatened to kick me out very aggressively because he said i couldn't be back there
the staff was insanely rude
do yourself a favor and go to another pool party
i've been to wet republic liquid drais and marquee
all were a million times better than this place
marquee is the best in my opinion
good food crappy service
been here before but the service tonight was unacceptable
we ordered a pizza fries and waters
had to wait long after our glasses were empy for refils and after we finished eating we waited over 30 minutes for our server to check in and see if everything was okay
at that point we simply wanted to leave and asked for a box and our check but we ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for that
the place was not packed by any means
the only positive was green olives on the pizza
actually it is 5 stars
still in drive thru line after 27 mins very slow service and horrible design of the drive thru lane
cross traffic trying get by and people walking everywhere
nice employees but they are slow as hell
too busy to get decent service
please hire more people for your peak hours
what a disappointing experience this was my first time coming here and for sure my last one
the selections are very limited for the price and they are not really well stocked with fresh items
none of the food here was something i would want to eat again and the dessert selections are just cookies and ice cream pretty much
cheap expensive to go food
this place looks more promising than the food court
i was hoping for quality healthy quick to go food
what i got was below quality for double the amount paid
i didn't mind paying 10 for a hearty wrap and another 9 for a panini
my husbands chicken kale wrap was all mostly kale and dressing
my veggie panini was the size of a sandwich and mostly bread
there were no pesto or any flavoring added
i ordered a side of fries which tastes dry
not a place a recommend for a quick bite
had high hopes given the location but it was not fresh fish and overall kinda scammy cause the nigori sake seemed watered down
hope this review saves someone's time and money
ordered three las vegans
got turkey burgers
sat for twenty more minutes in addition to the original twenty we waited for wrong orders and not even an offer to refund or discount
one cashier even tried to play the blame game
eat at your own risk
this place has really cheap prices and it's because they couldn't care less what they're serving you as long as they already got your money
do not eat here
terrible terrible servers sucks so much i usually never complain but i cant hold it in anymore
1
they charged me wrongly and they didn't even want to give me a refund
let me add that they never gave me the refund
the glasses girl said we cant do a refund
im like well you calculated wrong its not my problem to fix
its yours 2
i had to ask for lemons about 3 times 3
they didnt notify us that they didnt have cucumbers for one of the salads
which is the only reason my friend ordered the god dam salad
4
we just had to continually ask for the same thing to remind our colored eye server
5
it wasn't even busy
at most they had about 20 25 people
honestly thats easy enough to handle especially with 2 servers
theres a lady who has glasses and another one who has colored eyes
both need to get fired im a server as well and i've never experienced such bad serves
please just go to dennys if you want a decent breakfast because this place really sucks
went because of a groupon offer
if you know good sushi don't go here
their sushi looks fresh buts it's super fishy rice is too hard and overall just bad quality sushi
i've grocery store sushi better than this place
won't be coming back
the food is way over priced
spagetti had little sauce penne had only diced tomatoes as a sauce and came out 1 2 cold
not home made at all
don't bother
my glass of wine had the bottom full of the residue that you find at the bottom of an old bottle
i sent it back and was told i was given a glass from a new bottle
basically a tourist trap
waiter was good in his service
oh how i wanted to love this store and make it my new happy place i was so eager and anxious to see all of the amazing ikea wonderment from my childhood but sadly i was sorely disappointed
i've never seen such a pervasive sense of customer apathy as exhibited by the employees at this location
everyone walked around with frowns on their faces and a don't speak to me attitude
there were plenty of associates available but none were too eager to help
the poor customer service experience culminated with carlos the cash bank manager at the register
instead of listening to me in order to address my concerns he cut me off mid sentence to tell me to go fill out a customer comment card if i had any issues
mislabeled items poor customer service and an unfriendly atmosphere tell me that it's probably a good idea to steer clear of this place and find my disposable furniture elsewhere
it took you a long time to get here to vegas
quite frankly i wish you'd stayed away
server was josh sat in the lounge area
waited at least 50 min for our food a table sitting in front of us that came in after us
ate paid and left before our food was out
had to ask for refills service sucked the cook in the back that brought out food gave us more attention then our own service
sad
cockroach saw this beast at the dessert bar between the watermelon and the pineapple platters next to the lady making the crepes
i saw it and walked back to make sure i saw it right before i reported it to one of the managers
she ran to tell a guy behind the counter
this isn't even connected to the kitchen directly be wary everybody
question who the eff asked for more asians in the clubs hakkasan was a major fail in my book for many reasons
i would say skip this place unless your ideal mate is a 5'0 asian male
first of all the managers and promoters are incredibly rude and require photo submission to get on guestlist
seriously whaat you know those hot girls in 5inch heels and skin tight dresses hell no do they want to walk half a mile just to go up and down a bajillion stairs
get it together your club sucks and lady lingling is unsatisfied
also no outdoor pool patio area how's a girl supposed to hustle some drinks then hakksan has the perfect recipe for failure expensive as hell thirsty girls rude management terrible layout unhappy vegas goers
back to xs i go
possibly one of the worst restaurant i've eaten at
we were craving flavorful and savory food and saw china poblano and thought perfect because we love chinese and mexican
boy what a disappointment we had
everything was so bland and way overpriced for crappy food
we ordered several different tacos ceaser salad palm salad posole and chips and salsa
tasteless and under par
the tacos at dell tacos or taco bell taste better
the only thing that was ok were the chips salsa was disappointing so then it made the chips not enjoyable
i ordered mild chicken did i receive mild chicken no i did not i also asked for no gravy on my potatoes which were loaded with it
l will think twice
before going to this one again
service was bad and food was low quality i would not recommend this place
it should close the doors permanently the food was 100 years old
how come this place still open
i will think because the people that come here have never try real tapas so they don't know the real flavor
this place is really bad
the restaurant sell tapas well let me tell you this place is not tapas plus the chef here need to go to spain to learn how to cook some real tapas
the paella was really bad no flavor the sangria no good
no stars from me
i only gave this a star because the food was good
let's talk about the service
good lord they were so gosh darn rude i am baffled
i came in with a couple of friends and it's 12am on a friday night i would get if it was super packed but it wasn't
so we had to share a menu 3 waiters were waiting our table the reason for the quotations because they were doing anything but tending to us
not like we asked for much
just some more water since we had to wait so long to order get our food just everything in general
then we look over and see one of our waiters taking sake shots with his friends instead of taking care of other customers
also don't asked for anything else after they bring you your food unless you wanna get hit with a nasty attitude like it's an inconvenience
terrible service whoever did the hiring needs to be let go cause they aren't a good judge of character
we went here for mother's day with some friends for lunch
should have gone somewhere else
it's located nicely on the strip inside planet hollywood hotel casino
we sat on the patio where you can people watch and see the bellagio fountains doing their thing
it was nice
till the music started
first of all it was way too loud and you could barely hold a conversation but what was even worse was that the guy was horrible it would have been ok if he didn't sing
he was decent when jamming out on the keyboard and drum machine but then he opened his mouth
ugh
we all just looked at each other and laughed
since we had already had apps and ordered food there wasn't much else we could do
the waiter was cool and it wasn't his fault that the food was completely tasteless
we had rock shrimp for an appetizer which was ok then i had a salad with chicken which had no flavor whatsoever and it cost 19
i tried the curry and the fried rice from the others in the party and it was more of the same no flavor and way overpriced
i make better fried rice at home total bummer that the place turned out to be a rip off
anywhere else would have been better
live and learn i guess
what's better than a sushi place so close to home decided to take a family evening walk to sin city to pick up a few rolls for dinner
went in and ordered and requested for a to go order
got my basic california roll and spicy tuna roll
no complaints there
husband ordered the durango one other
he noted a weird heavy feeling in his stomach that he never just gets
went to sleep like all was good until i was woken up at 4 am to him rushing to the toilet horrible horrible horrible
seems like this has been a recurring problem at this location recently stay far away if food poisoning doesn't sound appealing to you i warned you
went there for the prime rib special after hearing about it from a few people
what a huge disappointment the meat was flavorless there was some weird rub on the outside
it wasn't your typical prime rib rub
the au jus they advertise beef broth from a can is what it tasted like
the baked potato was microwaved so many times it was rock hard on top
mushy microwaved corn
not sure why all the 5 stars
have been going here for years dim sum is usually good not sf good but decent
after today we will never go back
i have to say the staff has always been a tad rude but since we really like dim sum we kept going
today we went and there were 9 of us
my husband and i sat together and our 17 year old daughter and her six out of town girlfriends sat together
after we finished we walked over to the girl's table and told them we were going to go start the cars
i was standing by the table trying to stay out of one of the woman's way who had a cart
out of nowhere she literally yelled at me to move
i was a bit put off and said it really wasn't necessary to yell and we went outside
ten mins later the girl's came out to the car and our daughter said she was yelled at when they paid
they paid with cash and the woman who took the money came back to the table and sat down their change approximately 2 3
they told her to keep it as a tip
granted it wasn't a big tip but they are young girl's and frankly tipping isn't a requirement
she started scolding them and yelling how they needed to pay 10 tip she called them imbeciles over and over
they are young girl's and should not have been intimated into leaving a larger tip and definitely not called imbeciles
what type of restaurant employee calls their customer an imbecile our oldest daughter is a server and we get the importance of tipping
however it's up to the customer on what to tip and here there isn't much service
i didn't see anywhere here that a tip is required
i can tell you our daughter would never yell at a customer for not tipping
i thought about going back in to complain or call but know it would have been pointless as the one who yelled at them appears to be the manager
so instead i leave my review and let people decide
it's not the top dim sum so why put up with rude behavior
my money will be spent at restaurants where people are kind and appreciative
not even close as compared to nyc halal 7
99 for a small serving chicken halal rice is dissapointing
wont go for the second time
i went to purchase a slice of pizza
i was told a slice was 3
00
i said fine and would like to have the slice warmed up
the owner placed a slice in the oven
i asked to see the slice as well as the other slices in the pie
the owner took the slice of pizza now out of the oven and put it back with the other slices
he was not interested in now serving me
i told him i just wanted to see the other slices
maybe i wanted a slice with the vegatables or just a larger different slice
he said not interested in serving me
i am the customer and wanted to see the other slices
don't go to manhattan pizza on charelston blvd in summerlin nevada
the owner is not friendly
not a nice man
over the years this buffet has gone from being the best now to the worst
i've been going to the carnival world buffet since 2003
in 2003 they left me with an unforgettable experience and the food was really yummy
i went back to the buffet in 2008 and it was by far still really good food
then doing the recession they offered locals 50 percent off and it used to be a really great value
i would go once a week since it was only 12
99 for dinner
however i noticed in 2012 they started cutting back on the desserts the food quality starting becoming tasteless and cold and the price went up
recently this year its no longer 50 percent for a local if you have a gold total rewards card
it's only a 25 percent discount and its now 35 dollars for 2 adult locals for lunch
it's way overpriced for cold low endless food
the pastries are barely there and mainly just a few fruit pies and gelato
this used to be my favorite buffet but now i will never go back after the experience i have had this year with the food tasting bad
i noticed different managers were working there now than the managers in 2012
if they bring back the carnival world buffet like it were in 2008 then i would go once a week and pay the extra fee but to me its not worth it
the chefs do not care about the way the food is cooked and i think the food is just being reheated and nothing is cooked homemade
they produce cheap low end ingredients and make you pay for a high priced buffet
soo me and a friend just stopped in for a snack since we were going to see a show and it didn't start for another hour
the prices looked perfect so we choose this place
so after waiting for about 10 minutes a gentleman walked up and stared at us
he stood so close to me it felt like he was hitting on me
i didn't know if it was an employee or a random person
he didn't say anything
not hello not how are you what can i get you nothing
we looked at each other confused and it was so awkward
we just started ordering so the uncomfortable feeling would go away
we ordered some nachos and he walked away
i already knew this place sucked just by that moment
the nachos were so gross
the beans tasted like they came out of a can and not a name brand can either
the chicken had no flavor at all and you got some chesse topped on it
no sour cream no sauces at all beans cheese and chicken
this cost 10 dollars
he never came over to check on us and it took forever to get the check
i think i heard him talked once during the 40 minutes we were there
people are nice and the staff is in good shape but honestly we had dinner and breakfast there and it just isn't worth eating
minimal options and very slim on quality
stick with mcdonald's if you have to eat inside the luxor
this place is a joke the 2 girls work here were rude didn't get my family and i drink on time
we came on buffet hour first time i came here and will never ever come again
there were no food i paid 48
69 for nothing not worth time and money
hooters hooters hooters very disappointing
when you think hooters you think hot chics and nice bodies
usually hooter chics are outgoing and they sit and talk and flirt
i went with my boyfriend and cousin hello i was waiting on the waistress to be flirting with my boyfriend it never happen
it took about 15 minutes to get seated and they werent very busy
after getting seatting they took our order i ordered the phillycheesesteak and it tasted like puke my boyfriend ordered wings and fries the fries were a lil overdone
so after being disappointed about my boyfriend not being flirted with and not seeing nice boobies haha there was a guy waiter that packed up his food and was extrememly nice
he was the best part of the hooters expierence
will not be going back
this place is horrible with customer service and their staff is wearing this weird mouth guard wth
got me wondering what is wrong with this place food is old stale and you have to chase your food down cause they attack us with one cart of dim sum and then that was it
all i can say is horrible horrible horrible service
never coming back
very dissappinted in service
my boyfriend and i are vegan and specifically came here because another vegan told us of their great experience
i saw that some items on the menu could be made vegan upon request
i ordered the tomato basil soup which came with a grilled cheese all vegan
we also ordered a falafel sandwich
when the soup and grilled cheese arrived the grilled cheese looked a little suspicious
i asked if it was vegan and the woman said no they don't have vegan cheese
they had no answer when we asked why a non vegan side would come with a vegan item on the menu
instead of rectifying their own mistake we were offered two toothpicks with three small pieces of fruit
the manager said that's the best he could do
we will not return and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone
just simply not a very good chipotle
most chipotles out here are decent not necessarily do they all live up to the chipotle standard in california chipotles i've been too and i've been to a lot
but at this one they give very small portions and it just not that good
finally made me give up on emeril's restaurants
we were some of the first customers at emeril's at universal studios here in orlando which was outstanding when it first opened and the first few visits after that
then it started going downhill poor service and bad food
it was so bad we swore we wouldn't frequent any of emeril's restaurants ever again
then we were in vegas and at the palazzo looking for a place to eat
we foolishly decided to give delmonico a try
worst service we've had in a long time
the waiter acted like we were bothering him
he disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table
when he finally showed back up and i ordered a glass of wine he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table i didn't get it for a good 10 minutes
if i had been by myself i would have walked out but my wife didn't want to do that
dinner showed up and we started to eat
my glass of wine ran out with absolutely no sign of our waiter
i finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine
truly pathetic
food wise i don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks but i have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had
it was ok but certainly not worth the price we paid and trust me i don't mind spending money in a restaurant
i made a mistake by coming to i think the only mex
rest
that doesn't do taco tuesdays won't happen again will not be back
this poor review is for the lack of information on their yelp site and business website
i looked this place up before bringing my children here
we're in vegas visiting my sick grandmother
the kids have been cooped up in the icu waiting room all day for about 4 days
we took them to the park to run around but i decided to find something different that we cannot experience at home
the container park sounded like the place for a unique kind of fun checked out the website it had a great yellow area telling us about how family friendly it is with a tree house etc
i was excited i mean it's vegas the adults playground so i was happy to find something unique for my kiddos
but there's a curfew wtf no kids after 9 wtf why have it be family friendly and then kick the kids out and why not boldly state that on the website we wasted time and gas coming here finding parking walking etc
only to be promptly turned away since we got there at 8 45
you guys suck
came here on a business trip and was really disappointed
the pizza is about the same as chucky cheese thin and greasy
hopefully their other food is better
terrible service waitress amber was rude
she never came back to our table
i would not recommend this place to anyone
i'm not going to waste my time and write a five page review about this stupid place 1 food was extremely over priced
12 for a bowl of black beans and rice 2 we found an ant in our plate
wtf 3 the dinning room was too hot like it felt warmer than out side
no a c i guess 4 the cashier kid a little punk who wears a baseball hat for your reference was hitting on my wife wtf 5 too loud
you cant even hear anything
don't waste your time or your money
there are way better mexican places in town
ak las vegas
find some where else to sit and eat prior to your flight
i have tried it twice thinking maybe their lunch would be better than their breakfast but it was all terrible
i wish i could give a 1 2 star
the food was tough tough tough dr dry dry we had two salad plates before the meat came around
i had to ask for meat every tine
not even worth the groupon price refund please
the steak is so chewy and rough the scallop and onion soup are so salty have no idea why it gets 4 stars in yelp not recommended
giving my review before the good gets here
was fairly packed and this place was buzzing
this is usually a good sign took about 10 min to have anyone take our order
it's been close to 30 minutes and the 8 at our table have only gotten 2 dishes
rice and vermicelli
pho finally got here but still short a couple dishes
don't come here hungry or expecting to be noticed
other good sized groups who arrived after us even got their food before us
consistency in service is lacking tough to give x1 star
pho is pretty decent but not so good to have a place as busy as this
my wife and i went here to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary
we were of course expecting an awesome experience for such a special occasion but unfortunately we were thoroughly disappointed upon first entering the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised by the modern decor and atmosphere
the hostesses were nice and we were seated promptly
the waiter was at our table immediately and asked if we were interested in drinks my wife needed a few minute to look over the drink options and the waiter did not make any recommendations
i asked what kind of beers were available and he stated they had dos equis amber lager and lite i wasn't unaware that dos equis had a lite version so thinking it was something new i ordered it more on this later
the waiter returned shortly after with our drinks chips and salsa which were okay and laminated menus
yes cheap one sided laminated menus in a restaurant that charges 25 per entree
the menu did not have as many items as we expected and the descriptions for each item were extremely vague
we decided to start with the chorizo sopes and mexican street corn
both items were brought to our table after about 5 minutes and were both actually pretty tasty but not mind blowing
now back to the dos equis lite i was actually given a lager and when i informed the waiter that i ordered a lite he said that lager is the lite
wtf right shortly after the appetizers were delivered our waiter returned for our entree order
he didn't seem to know much about the items and had no recommendations
i ordered the chicken torta and my wife ordered the beef filet fajitas
there's an item called yucca fries and when i asked the waiter what those are he said i think they're like sweet potato fries
i decided to order those as well
the entrees didn't take too long to come out after taking our first bites my wife and i wished they had never come out
my chicken torta consisted of flavorless chicken avocados and way too much black bean paste it was served with spinach on the side
just plain spinach with a drizzle of some unidentifiable substance which i wasn't sure if i was supposed to put on my torta or eat as a salad
my wife's fajitas were equally as flavorless and the beef was extremely chewy
in fact if there were such a thing as negative flavor these dishes would qualify
oh and the yucca fries which the waiter thought were sweet potato fries were just regular steak fries also with no flavor
the waiter came by to ask how our food tasted and i let him know that we thought our food was flavorless which is something i have never done but this food was so bad i felt compelled to do so
i asked if he could bring out some hot sauce or something to add some flavor even salt and pepper would've improved these dishes he stated that all they had was tabasco
now this is supposed to be a mexican restaurant which means it should have its own house hot sauce or at least cholula or tapatio but nope just tabasco
apparently our displeasure upset the waiter and he was rude for the remainder of our dinner like it was our fault the food was bad i promptly asked for the overpriced bill and left absolutely no tip also something i had never done
i highly recommend that no one should eat here i honestly would've rather eaten at chevy's
i was super excited to go here because it was me and my newly fiances celebration engagement date
we paid 20 to get there because we take uber and paid 30 for food mind you we only got a philly and fruit
with that being said we are not in the best shape with money so having spent 50 for the worst service was not okay
we rarely go on dates so it was really frustrating that all this happened
but even then we still paid for our meal
we get there and after waiting 15 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us when she did all she said was are you guys ready to order
i am a server and am very easy to please because i am a server i am way more lenient about things then others
but this experience was unacceptable
after the long wait when we finally got our food which was good we asked for ranch and when we did she said i know i'm getting it in a very rude way and also never smiled
then it took her about 8 minutes to get a little side of ranch
by then my boyfriend had maybe 2 bites left
the table in front of us had asked for a lemonade 5x in total and didn't even get that
they not only had to ask the busser who blew them off and continued setting up silverware but also another server who still didn't bring the lemonade by then they were extremely upset and left
so we definitely were not the only unhappy people
very disappointed because i was so excited for this date
will not be returning unless things change
too small and way way overrated too crowded and it is so hard to get in
at the end complete disappointment
i don't know why but it always seems like the employees at the second window are always rude
they are so stingy on sauces even if you paid for it
the stinginess also comes with a side of attitude
just had lunch here i order salmon that after 20 minutes all the other food was served and it never was served the managers explanation was that they got to many people at once
if you are in the restaurant business you are at a high end hotel that has conventions all the time and your response is that close the dam business down
i'm rating one star again just hoping to give this restaurant a fair rate
when we got there there was a big family of 11 people eating and taking up all tables which was fine cuz they were actually leaving in mins but the woman i mentioned told us there was no table for us unless we took it togo
i was confused thinking somebody else had made reservation but the fact was no
the family left before we placed our orders
bedsides that bixth rolled her eyes at us when we told her we were five of us
super disappointed and unhappy with this meal
feel very bad when i recall the woman's face
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had everything was mushy the pad tai had in it which i've never seen and didn't like
the egg rolls were bland and the orange chicken was not very flavorful
have had the worst luck having items removed from the listed item
the place is so good but for me the constant errors has forced me to take my business elsewhere and i'm so sad about that
never made it through the door wait staff doesn't follow their own rules
we walked up to this restaurant following our noses from the bar next door
we would have eaten there except we were waiting to be seated as the sign outside clearly states when a group of people the same size decided to walk right past us to the door
the host greeted them at the door and sat them even though we were there first
when he came back he told us they had no more seats and there would be a long wait
so we left
there is a ramen place around the corner with far better manners
do not come here very very rude people when i called to order they cussed at my sister over the phone and then hung up on her not wasting my time here and will not dare give them business
hate to write a bad review for this place bc i love the food
but this is the 2nd time i've gotten food poisoning from the chicken
will never go back
i waited longer than approximately told by the rep let alone ten minutes was 30 more minutes than promised at the front desk manager
working in retail has taught me one thing
be honest with your guest regardless of wait time
they would rather know the truth than to feel like you are lying for them to pay
courtney is the only reason our bachelor party left safely without playing
i appreciate the free offers afterwards but the truth is simple here your entire front desk team needs a revamp
if you hate your job quit
don't make your guest feel like they need to be rich and tip you to have a good time
you should give the same service regardless of price paid
i was offered floor 3 as a parting gift to waiting almost two hours for one swing
i will surely spread the news
if your on vacation save your time for something more fun that won't have you waiting for 2 hours to swing a golf club at a night club
thanks nick for comping my 20 tab that was still charged to my card
thanks for taking an extra 20 minutes to close out my tab because you guys were called on unprofessional customer service
if your on vacation and you saw the hype of this experience beforehand as i did let this review be a reality check
you will wait a while
something the front desk has a very hard time being honest about
my wife and i are staying at the encore
our concierge suggested us to try this buffet
from the moment we arrived
it was a bad experience
we even paid for the vip line
not very vip with a wait over 35 minutes
once we we're sat
we waited 15 minutes for a server to take our drink order
she was very nice and apologetic
we served our selves two small servings
the sushi was warm they kept running out of crab legs that have to be the smallest i've ever seen
they kept serving empty oyster shells and the prime rib was dry and over cooked
to top it off my wife had to breast feed our child remind you
she was completely covered up and wasn't noticeable whatsoever
a server came over and asked if she could stop or do it some place else
so we decided to leave
i spoke to the manager today
she apologized
that is illegal and mr wynn will be getting a letter very soon
never got to the point of eating anything
the server was beyond rude
he almost hit my wife in the face with his elbow while setting the water glasses down
cut her off while she was trying to order a drink after he asked what she wanted
and we left when he got pissed off that i asked for clean water glasses since all three had green food pieces in the glasses with dry food chuncks on the outside of them
i know it happens but to jerk the glasses off the table splashing water out of them
maybe he was having a bad night but we didn't go there to get treated like crap
so sadly i can't speak about the food
but there is an italian joint up in the food court that was really good
went to watch a husker game
real husker's from nebraska are not rude like this
we didn't even get three chance to eat or drink
left after being shoved and t told to move
scale 1 10 i give them 1 2
due to the special occasion from our 20th anniversary celebration with early reservation we did they made it double booked in one small place
i think they take advantage on us because all of us is from out of town
also unfair from the other group
and the food is not that good scale of 1 10 maybe 2
another thing busy weekend with party reservation men's restroom broken
its good i always bring my sanitizer in my pocket
