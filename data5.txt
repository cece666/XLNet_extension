the surf and turf here was one of the best i've had
filet mignon and lobster tail was very good
i generally dont think the food in vegas is great but after being dissappointed on many occasions i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of our meal
thanks to the taste i was lured to this restaurant only to find that it is a somehat hidden jewel in new york new york close to the sometimes obnoxious piana bar time square
the side of green beans were delish and the potatos are just meh
for desert they served an extremely delicious lemon pudding which taste more tart than pudding
it was fabulous
i think gallaghers is good for couples groups and even kids
i really only spend a few minutes at the bar while i wait for take out food but the staff and the patrons are all nice people
but the food
the burgers specifically
are so good
as a local i've been to all the gourmet burger spots and the strip and these burgers can compete with any of them
maybe i like the johnny vegas burger because i'm johnny v as well who knows but it's a tasty burger
great meal and the service was terrific
derek kenny and eddy you are the best the location is perfect and nice outdoor setting if you wish to watch the people
i would recommend this restaurant good food and great service
sick sick sick and my sick i mean fu ng amazing
now i cannot say that my experience at tao was typical but if you're a blonde girl in a dress perhaps your night at tao will go something like mine did
my group of 11 girls arrived around 10ish and we'd been hooked up by yelper myke
no cover sweet
we went inside and since it was early we checked out the rooms and got drinks easily
we went upstairs and checked out tao beach
the bartenders were pretty delicious looking
patron shot number one happened
then we headed back down to the club
the dance floor still wasn't going off yet so we went out to the balcony which had a beautiful view of the water below as well as the vegas strip
we went in and started dancing not too crowded good times were being had and then the bouncer asked if i wanted to dance up on the platform
done and done i was up on the platform having a good time with my friends and i started eye flirting with the guys in the vip booth below
when it came time to exit the platform mr
vip helped me down the stairs and before i know it the night became an endless stream of vodka tonics and tequila shots all courtesy of some dude from new york who had just become president of his company
bottles of champagne with sparklers in them also arrived at the table
the club was packed wall to wall but in the booth it was spacious and comfy
we had our own cocktail girl as well as our own security guard
and yes as someone mentioned below security walks you to the bathroom
speaking of the bathrooms the doors are glass and when you lock the door they go from clear to frosted trippy getting free vip treatment from strangers is a rare thing but at tao you might find the kind of high rollers who can make it happen for you
and if you're a big baller who can afford to go vip at tao just make sure that you say hello to your friendly blonde platform dancer
and get her a shot of patron while you're at it
the food was terrific probably the best breakfast food i've ever had however the lady at the cash register seemed quite mean with her employees
i would definitely still come here though
i shall surely suggest it to everyone thumbs up guys
there isn't much to say
great food and great service
what more can you ask for i like the high 5 fiber bread garlic cheese loaf and the savannah bars
yum yum yummy
best deal in town 1 tacos
sopes are super delicious
won't hear a peep out of my son until he finished his asada fries
awesome food and even better service ask for ezekiel and he'll take great care of you
my boyfriend and i stopped in for a quick lunch and the bar was packed so we opted for a booth
it was really nice that they honored hh at the tables too and not just the bar
we got the hh bean dip guacamole corn fritters and the shrimp tacos
the complimentary salsa was great and super flavorful
everything was great
the margaritas were great and very generous in size
will definitely be back
keep up the great work guys
great food
good ambiance we got there early so seating was quick
the place filled up fast
it ski wonder because the food is that good
beware
when they say 10
they mean it i liked the stuffed chicken appetizer and the spicy basil my friend had the catfish
now that was good she picked 10 so
i just tasted it
overall a great place for a meal
the food here is amazing
i have ate here a couple times and the food is so yummy i especially love the various sauces and the cool drinks it offers
i always like the brown rice and the egg on top of the chicken are so good i highly recommend for catering quick bites late night food craving food whatever a most have
i've been here twice and have had breakfast biscuits and gravy and lunch french onion soup and california salad i think
service was good the first time lunch and great the second time
had one of the best dinners here
everything was great
i asked the hostess if we could eat outside and we were given an amazing table right on the water
it was so fun to eat such great food while enjoying the water show every 15 minutes
omg good clam chowder the food here is delicious
best known for their killer shrimp served with french bread to sop up all the juices
definitely has a kick even if you have a cold you would enjoy the taste it's that spicy
lots to choose from
we loved the asian wings moist and flavorful
great environment for a girls or guys night out sports fans etc
happy hour has lots to choose from 7 days a week 3 6pm
lobster mac and cheese is sinful good
great from the minute we were greeted at the door
incredible service and the food is wonderful
very worth the money
this is was the best place in vegas to catch chargers games
sadly after 30 years the doors will be closing on monday november 25 2013
november 24 2013 will be our final chargers game
please find our new home at brewske's pub at 3645 s durango between spring mountain flamingo
thanks for the memories rick
better than hot n juicy boiling crab
i love the craw fish with the cravin cajun sauce and lemon pepper shrimp
the jambalaya is rich the alfredo pasta is creamy
mmmm
friendly servers
if you like teppanyaki benihanas style cooking you've gotta try this place
the food is as good as what you'd find at a 50 person restaurant like benihanas but costs less than 10 person
the filet and the shrimp are spectacular
both the fried rice and yakisoba are very delicious dishes to complement your meal
they have a sauce bar and i'd recommend the yumyum sauce
if you like spicy try mixing the yumyum withe the spicy sauce
both the fried rice and yakisoba are very delicious dishes to complement your meal

consistency it has the consistency of really soft ice cream
fruits we got strawberry and aloe vera
it was fresh and delicious
taste customizable toppings allows each person to get the exact taste they want
any way you look at it this sugary dessert is delectable
compared to taiwanese shaved ice taste it tastes about the same
what's lacking is the way shaved ice looks like tiny sheets of ice meshed together
availability since i don't know of any other place in vegas that serves taiwanese shaved ice and class 302 in cali quite a drive this would be the place to get your shaved ice substitute
recommendations i'd recommend this place if you're looking for a great dessert spot
it's probably better to share since the sizes are quite large
the business has since hired more staff
i'm thrilled
this is my go to sushi place
i love chicken i give this place five stars the chicken is great and the place is always clean
the staff are professional and kind
yes eat here you will like this they have extra good fries and toast that makes this place one of a kind
the sauce is above five stars so they are the complete package stop in today you just may see me their
absolutely love this place i stopped in on my lunch break yesterday and had the carne asada torta and it was incredible the service was the best i can recall in a long time and the price was not at all bad
i went in again for lunch today and ordered the carne asada burrito
phrank warned me it wouldn't be as good as the torta but i beg to differ i enjoyed the burrito twice as much and this is now one of my favorite spots in las vegas
catching up on my reviews and i had forgotten to go back to my roots
this korean tapas like restaurant is a bit off the best of path from my home route however worth the travel
ryan the owner is always there which is a huge sign of dedication to the success of this restaurant
my favorite dish is the classic spin on jajangmyun black bean sauce noodles
but it's hard to pick one favorite when they have dishes such as 30hr sous vide pork belly and the braised short ribs served on top of a scallop potato stack
the surf and turf roll is a sea bass and bulgogi sushi roll that will bring land and sea harmoniously in each bite and will make your tastebuds go wild
as most people only think of bbq when they think of korean this place will be sure to give a modern and tasteful spin on korean flavors and new attributes to the culture
3 words guilty vegan pleasure
after going vegan i thought i would never have a decent doughnut again
i was wrong
this place is amazing
2 shots 2 tacos 2 beers 2 ritas we had so much fun
and it kept us closer to our budget than any of the other joints in town
hint if service seems slow go sit at the bar
the restaurant staff are really friendly
here for the first time the restaurant is nice and very spacious
ordered the tan tan men very delicious
finally a sushiburrito in the southwest part of town
i am a big fan of the one on sahara
this is so much closer to home
i got the rodondo and it is the same as the 3 amigos at the sahara location
fish were very fresh and for this week they are having 15 off your meal since it is their soft opening
will be back for more
very good food
top quality
kind of expensive but what in vegas isnt expensive
i've been going to pkwy tavern since it opened
i always go in to get my five
i visited the outside bar yesterday to see madison
she always has a smile and is one of my favorite bartenders
she is attentive to all my needs and even though it's hot as hell outside i will sit out there to enjoy her company while enjoying my beers
also the outside patio is the perfect place to watch the football games with every tv covering a different game as well as all the games to play during halftime
i came here on a thursday with my family and friends to give viva mercado's a try after seeing the great yelp reviews
let me tell you that our food was amazing service was outstanding location was great we ordered the nachos with chicken as our appetizer
so awesome next came our main courses and my enchiladas with rice and beans were so delicious it reminded me of fresh mexican food back home in ca
ingredients were fresh the cheese was melted so perfectly and the red sauce tasted so good and authentic
in fact everybody was extremely pleased with their dishes
we just couldn't stop complimenting our food it was just that good even though very full and extremely satisfied we opted for 2 orders of the fried ice cream for desert to be shared amongst us all
why did it have to be so perfect why we all came to the conclusion that we have found our new favorite mexican restaurant as our go to spot for a very tasty authentic mexican meal
i highly recommend viva mercado's mexican bar and grill for the next time you crave really good mexican food enjoy
the food was amazing delicious we didn't eat in we ordered through a delivery service bitesqaud i look forward to eating in their dinning room if you love true tasting persian cuisine this is the place to go or on line
this place is just incredible
hand crafted old school cocktails are to die for
i hope you have patience because service is always a bit bit slow but i realize these cocktails take time
so i don't mind
and it's worth it
the food is always outstanding
i'd recommend going for happy hour everything is half off thus making a rather expensive meal very affordable even the steaks are half off the bartenders servers and even porters are all top notch and professional very much appreciated this spot is a real vegas gem
i love this place service and food were wonderful
lyn explained everything to me
from the pepperoni pizza the wall street pizza to their salads and wings
i had the roasted cauliflower pizza and it was delicious
i love roasted cauliflower i also had the garlic knots and wings
omg they were both amazing the garlic knots had enough garlic and salt on them that it made me want to drink it down with a beer
so i ordered a pbr
lyn asked me how spicy i wanted the wings
i got it very spicy
many places who serve hot wings say they're hot when they're normally not
wicked slice wings are extra spicy
they use the carolina reaper pepper which is the hottest pepper in the world
i must say the wings were hot
they were so good i wanna go back and order more
i always take the wings here to go
this branch here in the santa fe is closest to my house and i've always had a good experience ordering from here
usually when i come in though it's not busy so i can't attest much for the quality during busy hours but i never have had issues from the food
the other reviews i've read about this location give it an average rating so perhaps the dine in and take out quality is different i will keep coming back due to the convenience and my experiences here
i don't like eating in casino food courts anyways so i'll keep carrying out
friendly staff
great wings
we have ordered take out from jun's at least 10 times lost track
we originally ate at their eastern location when we lived on that side of town and were thrilled to see one opening across the street from us
we have tried everything
meat jun bulgogi spicy chicken kalbi
all excellent and the side dishes are great too the kimchi seafood pancake is another must
i highly recommend them for easy quick tasty korean
this is a hidden gem that you must try if you're in the mood for italian
everything we ate was fantastic as was the service
vegas is definitely on spot with its's food game
fyi
week nights equals no wait
our favorite ramen place
even if we have to wait for a while it's worth it
been coming to this place for more than 5 years every winter time this is the first place we come to for ramen
would recommend it to anyone you wont be disappointed
delicious meal omg
their fries are so perfectly done
friendly staff and good prices
best mcdonald's ever walked over after leaving a gambling binge
the cashiers were friendly ps they do not take chips as payment cash credit only
exotic cars and traditional italian cuisine packaged together need a spot for a private event seriously owner lorenzo knows how to put it together
i just keep saying wow what a great find
the delicious food ambiance music decor and the attentive owner ryan make this tapas bar the perfect place for a date
when i am in vegas this is my go to always
service is great food is great drinks are great
menu is very diverse enough to please everyone
can not go wrong here
yes
this place definitely deserves a 5 star
the green tea matcha milk was a bit strong but it still had a great taste
i tried the okinawa as suggested by a friend of mine and it was to die for the creaminess and the quality of the drink was very good very natural
the temperature was just right
i ordered mine with pudding and boba i am going back for sure
the location is out of the way though so i suggest opening up one near summerlin
kaboom that place just blew my mind and i am a very critical foodie restaurant type
first of service killed it
great little hipster hostesses who obviously have experience cuz they knew how the room flowed and they managed the tables well
nice bartender who knew the menu inside and out
managers stopped by to ensure good dining
well done
cocktails noir margarita was good the blood orange was tremendous appetizer peruvian ceviche was bomb
mahi mahi i think
a total win
nice palate starter
fresh and delicious
main chicken poblano enchiladas holy crap do not go there and not order this
it should enter a competition or something
i wish i had a bigger vocabulary to state the magnificence of my meal
but alas it was simply a great experience
our experience could not have been better from the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty
we were immediately shown to a table and ordered drinks
from there we had appetizers more drinks and our entrees
after ordering beer and blood marys we had oysters rockefeller clams casino veal marsala twice baked potatoes lyonnaise potatoes toasted raviolis which were a bonus as we didn't order them and creamed corn
i swear i could have stayed for 2 days i mentioned that i had a groupon and not an eyelash was batted
they retrieved it from my phone and we moved on without missing a beat
every single staff member was impeccably dressed courteous and accommodating
i really did feel like i was rat pack worthy all the way down the music being played
we finished dinner and still managed to have enough leftovers to fill a bag
we don't eat a lot but like to try a lot of different things
after paying the check and leaving the restaurant we were called back by a staff member
it seems groupon automatically adds the gratuity and i had added another on top
i find it refreshing and ethical that they would hurry out to find us to let me alter the total
we have definitely added a new regular place to vist on every trip
i can't believe i didn't know about them before but believe you me i'll never forget them next time i'm asking for sheckie greene's table so my butt can sit in the same grooves as his
best ramen in town to be honest it was the first and only time i ate ramen and it was great very nice and cozy place awesome staff tasty ramen great prices for good meal can't wait to go there again for my next ramen
when they have a 30 minute wait at 9am on a thursday they must be doing something right
i got one of the skillets with chorizo
i honestly don't remember which one because i was in a food coma when i left
i will for sure get comatose there again soon i hope
simply amazing we had the world renown chicken and waffle fried chicken benedict and the tractor pancake and my goodness it was amazing and such huge portions
man vs food was not lying about this place being amazing
since my brother is in town he wanted to try something i haven't tried before so i decided to try park on fremont
we sat outside and reviewed the menu and neither of us were really thrilled but decided we could swing it
i was pointing out some of the newer places when i saw the smashed pig and said when did that open since no one had acknowledged us at park yet we got up and crossed the street to check out the menu
the front bar guy sold us on the two person beef hanger steak butcher block and told us they had opened two days ago
so we came on in to give it a try
that was an excellent choice
we started out with the lamb tacos which had nicely spiced and tender lamb in a crispy fried eggplant shell topped with sweet pepper chutney
then our main arrived and it was glorious
the beef was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was superb
the sakai sauce that came with it was a perfect accompaniment to that and the greens
the mashed potatoes had to have had at least a stick of butter in them that was a very good thing
and the simple field green salad that accompanied it had a ginger dressing my brother loved
it was quite simply one of the best meals i have had in vegas
we also had the sticky toffee pudding which was good but couldn't live up the main course
i also ordered their tow rag cocktail which was quite refreshing and not very sweet at all
my brother tried the tenya creek hefeweizen which was so good we both got another
brandon was our server and he was informative and attentive
martin the owner even stopped by the table to make sure everything was fine
i will most definitely be stopping back in to give lunch a try one friday
saturday breakfast arrived 10 45am approx 25 guests waiting inside and out a table for two took only 10 minutes i've been wanting to try this place for a while now but the crowds and the wait discouraged me from trying
all the good reviews kept this place on my radar so when a friend wanted to try somewhere new we came here
the wait was not bad at all especially because as we waited we had the menu to look over and wow there are lots to look
eggs benedict omlets pancakes skillets and more
today i went with the crazy chicken omlet you're crazy for not trying it
it's a plateful so much so that we got a box to enjoy it later
outstanding service they even have happy sad face eggs you can display on your table to signal for service i would probably come here again and again to try the rest of the menu
the thing about this restaurant is every item on the menu is just very good the mosh rooms the crunchy seaweed the pork the everything really
bomb ass ceviche and revuelta pupusas than most restaurants for me atleast
service is alright but definitely one of me and moms fav spot
i come to this place at least twice a month on late saturday night because it opens until 6 a
m
on weekends
this place is not ayce but that's because they offer high quality sushi
i like to get the unagi bowl and miso soup if i'm trying to get something quick to eat
the presentation of the unagi bowl is great and it taste absolutely delicious
my favorite roll here is the rattle snake roll and i get it every time i go
the hamachi kama is also a must it's perfectly seasoned and grilled and it practically melts in your mouth
they are getting ready for a new location at the linq so they have been training new waiters so be patient if you get one of the new ones the sushi chefs are also amazing and have fun personalities if you're sitting at the bar
they like to drink dance and sing while making sushi note this place is a bit pricy because of the quality but it's worth it
love brew tea bar i have seen it many times before i decided to try it i always order what they recommend
i usually get the coffee latte with sea salt carmel and sometimes boba
you can order half sweet too
i feel like cheers when i go there now i guess i like them a lot i have also tried the black tea and the rose milk tea someday i will get through the whole menu
we ordered in this morning and both the coffee breakfast was out of this world i still recommend going in to meet dino and to get the all around experience but my goodness the food always insanely delicious
every time i'm in vegas i try to come to this place
if you think college ramen noodles you are mistaken
here ramen is a meal in itself
i usually get an order of gyoza to go with it
when speaking about japanese food most people think sushi or hibachi
not here
here you'll find fares that are served in regular restaurants ramen donburi food that is cooked or fried or grilled
it's off the beaten path not on the strip but that's ok
it's also funny to watch the errant non japanese hunt for a menu that is written in english
upscale mexican this is not our first attempt to try this particular mexican restaurant
just this past monday we tried for an early dinner and there were no open tables till after 10 pm
we asked ouselves why so popular on a monday only later we find out it is half off everything including drinks for locals onlye on mondays
we must remember resevations only for mondays
well that is not going to happen anytime soon
so we settled for an early friday lunch and ordered the following chapulines grasshoppers fried in chili lime sauce
pure protein
eat together with their awesome cilantro rice
small sized grasshoppers and the legs don't get in the way
haven't had chapulines since we were in washington dc
street tacos carnitas al pastor and carne asada served with cilantro rice and refried black beans
each packed with freshly cooked meats held in a triple skinned corn tortilla taco
deceivingly most filling and ravingly delish
seafood enchiladas two large flour tortilla enchiladas with cilantro rice and refried red beans
it was wanting delicious
had reached our capacity and most of this entree we took home with us
as a reward for a check in on yelp
com we received a complimentary flan dessert
that executive chef paco personally delivered to our table
perhaps the best tasting flan we have ever devoured and we are not the only ones to have said the same
el dorada cantina is uniquely situated next door to sapphires an adult entertainment venue
at first we were a bit stigmatized while not realizing they were not part of sapphires
the location brought back memories of a portland mexican eatery within a strip club
another uniqueness is their belief in serving dairy products free of gmos and antibotics plus all their vegetables meats and fish sourced from farms that are free of antibiotics pesticides and steroids
if you want to learn more about their culinary philosophy check out their website
even though we missed out on the half off monday special for locals the regular prices were not out of line considering the upscale venue
the pizza was amazing the crust is so good
i order the high roller pizza and they definitely aren't skimpy on the toppings
very delicious
wow i don't know what else to say
this place is just amazing
they live up to the twisted farm food they claim to serve
i love the griddled french toast it is just so darn good it was priced at 12
95 and the portion was generous
i am in love with this french toast and it will not be the last time i order it the plates of food are enormous so you must keep that in mind
inside is normally packed but they have plenty of people working and keep things running smoothly
i was pleased to see they have a lunch and dinner menu
the breakfast will be hard to live up to but i want to come back and try out some their salads and sandwiches
you wont be disappointed i promise give it a try
this place was a surprise to find
we were out looking for some mexican food and read the reviews les us here
it is attached to a gentlemans club and while parking i was unsure if i was even at the correct location
once inside i was impressed with the decor and ordered the street tacos
once again i was impressed because there was a taco special and i wanted to try it all
once i heard the sale price i was excited to get the carnitas and carne asada
both were great
carnitas was awesome and filled with flavor
the salsa is awesome and i couldn't resist trying the pozole soup because no mexican place has it in new england
that was great too
i wish i could teleport this place to massachusetts
oh fresh made margaritas too
this is a great place to hang out with friends
private rooms allow for shy individuals to openly sing their hearts out in comfort and the staff jacob was awesome is very friendly and quick to respond to guests
my friends and i exchange gifts every year and this was definitely the perfect place to share a private and personal moment and continue to have a great time afterwards
as always an excellent experience
i ordered the double double animal style fries and a chocolate shake
then sat outside watched vegas's area of crazy people walk by and savored my meal
a great chance to get my california groove on
living in the midwest i miss getting my fix of in n out burgers
break away from boring strip breakfast and come over here
this place is an absolute gem
you must try the jamms french toast
i do not even like french toast that much and this is good
sandy is among the best servers i have had
i had not been there in 4 months and she remembered our names
i promise i am not just saying that because sandy's omelette is the best egg on the menu
cannot say enough about the pot of bread
try whatever the special is
i have never gone wrong
worth the wait but if you avoid weekends from 9 30 noon you should be fine
after we stuffed ourselves silly we asked them to call us a cab
they said no
and then had their limo driver take us back to our hotel
they go above and beyond for their customers
also the decor and overall ambiance is very inviting
i felt like i was back in old vegas waiting for the rat pack to come and grab a table
if you go to vegas this should be a main attraction
best buffet in vegas
go on the weekend for the gourmet buffet with kobe beef and rack of lamb
kobe was tougher than the prime rib but the land was great
crab legs and shrimp were ok
overcooked and bland taste
awesome desserts
this place will forever hold a special place in my heart not only because my husband took me here the night he proposed but also because their food is amazing
a lovely and romantic ambiance with staff who are always on their a game
you can't go wrong with mon ami gabi
i do suggest making reservations because they get packed
the classique steak is my favorite
a delicious steak at a very reasonable price
one of the better karaoke spots
the bar is great food is great heard the fried chicken is the best
tonight was introduced to this great drink nikka
i will come again
love this place the only problem is this location is pretty small and they are usually pretty busy unless you go early enough delicious food
the food and drinks are delicious
i personally would recommend getting the popcorn as an appetizer
it was made to perfection
all the drinks have names of some of the movies he produced
to start they bring a lovely bread assortment with dipping sauces don't miss the rosemary roll the cheese dishes are various sizes and assortments depending on the size of your table
the only thing i will warn you of is that they tell you the portions aren't large enough to share but they are
we go to the gas station to get the mini carne asada tacos
the best street tacos around the southwest
we went for an early saturday dinner and the atmosphere was perfect not too loud for conversation
the surf and turf was incredible surpassing my wildest expectations
the mac and cheese was a glorious cheesy gift from heaven
desserts were good too but how much dessert can you eat after that much delicious steak
so happy to be able to try this restaurant in vegas
definitely a must while in town
food was amazing and so was the atmosphere
awesome affordable wonderful food definitely try the sausage and the meatballs sangria was fantastic
ambiance was wonderful sat outside
tremendous value for las vegas well worth the trip off the strip
would most definitely go back again
yuzu is the best japanese food i have had in las vegas
there is something unique about the quality and cut of the fish used here that makes the taste of all the food completely impeccable
the menu has a wide distribution of inexpensive and luxurious food items which makes ordering comfortable and easy for any budget
my favorites so far have been the yellowtail jalapeno a must under their cold items list as well as their different types of sushi
my dad had the ribeye hotpot which he loved any hotpot dish is brought out on a mini burner that is a joy to see
their yuzu sorbet was amazing and an absolute delight to enjoy
will be returning here for sure
i am so glad i stumbled upon this place the other day amazing service and great food
for the appetizer i tried the not your nachos which were so different in such a tasteful way
i had the cleaver salad which was delicious
ashley was a great server very attentive and nice
i can't wait to come back here
if you find yourself in orleans or even looking for something to eat i can't imagine this place letting you down
let's just say it was bomb bomb bomb
best family italian and pizza joint in vegas
hell their burger is one of the better ones i've had in vegas
cozy little place that gets pretty hot due to the size and proximity of the pizza ovens
the food comes in huge portions and is very high in quality
their pizza is to die for and don't be afraid to try all 3 types my favorite is the ny style but the chicago deep dish and sicilian are both stellar
there is a decent wine list not very pricey and their beer selection is great
if you come in the summer park out back there is covered parking
serendipity 3 was such a treat
on our final day in las vegas we stopped here to have lunch before heading over to the airport
there was a little wait but wow
it was so worth it
our waitress was a doll and i took her recommendation and ordered a burger this is not something i do often but omgoodness the abc burger was probably the best burger that i have ever had
my husband had the full monty and it was great as well we were both pretty full by the end but we certainly had to save some room for the frozen hot chocolate
we chose the oreo flavor and it was so yummy
i am so glad we finally made it over to serendipity 3 we cannot wait for our trip next march to head on over again to serendipity
yum
had a fantastic meal here last night
we had a party of 12
that can sometimes be a problem with service but the staff pulled everything off perfectly
dishes came and went like magic
our server was super knowledgeable about all the the selections and had great recommendations
the wine was also paired perfectly
now to the food
i had antipasto of grilled octopus
it was indescribably delicious
tender and moist presented on a bed of beans with a bright crisp limoncello vignette
best octopus i've ever had
secondi was a lobster pasta
tender lobster in a slightly spicy tomato sauce
the house made pasta was perfect
one of the best italian meals i've had
absolutely loved this place when i went there while i was on a business trip
since then i have bought a second home in las vegas and plan on frequenting this place whenever i have a chance
omg mind blowing
i didn't expect it to be this good
i had baby back ribs spare ribs and burnt ends with corn nuggets
everything was seasoned right and juicy
definitely coming back
words cannot express my deep love for the food this place has to offer
it's an instant hangover cure that's for sure
they're open anytime which is super convenient and it doesn't take very long to get your food and get on your way
i love the chorizo potato eggs burrito the carne asada fries make me week in the knees
the prices aren't bad either but they could use an update on their a c
came here for christmas dinner and the wait wasn't long at all maybe 7 minutes max we got seated and our waitress tiffany instantly greeted our table and quickly took our drink orders
she was extremely friendly and personable and made this breakfast even more wonderful than we could've hoped for
my new favorite quick lunch place fresh food friendly and helpful service clean sitting area and great selection
first time visiting a poke bar they were super helpful with tasting samples and taking me through the process
i will be a weekly repeat visitor
first time at this place loved it great service and reasonable prices
very much a hole in the wall
definitively will come again
every single bite was a m a z i n g i think i found my new fav spot
i got the salmon bento box and oh boy let me tell you it was delicious definitely coming back again and highly recommend kuben owner or employee was very friendly and outgoing too i'd give this place 10000 10 they also play great music
cafe summer is a very nice place
very good drinks and food
deserts are amazing
definitely will come back
this is by far the best restaurant i have ever frequented
i am rating mr mamas a five star place for everything the food customer service facility and price
the owner nick will open the door and greet you when you walk up to the restaurant
then he will get you seated right away
and if the place is busy he will let you know how long your wait will be offer you a chair and be extra attentive to you
while he is doing this he is aware of everything that is going on in his restaurant from the guests needs to the activities of his staff
this place is full of good energy claudia was our great waitress
she served us water and coffee then took our orders and came back with our hot food not too long after
she the other staff members the owner and even the hostess made their rounds through out the restaurant and stopped by our table often enough to clear empty plates and to make sure that our water glasses and coffee cups were never empty
we didn't order anything extraordinary but what we did order was excellent pancakes really really good
ham steak perfect portion perfectly cooked
hash browns golden crispy
biscuit gravy very good
gravy had bits of sausage and bacon in it
wedge salad they added sliced onions tomatoes and cucumbers to it
this added to the presentation
i loved it but husband would ask for those on the side next time
home fries truly the best bacon perfectly not overly cooked crispy
cinnamon rolls daughter got a free one for her birthday
i am not big on sweets but this is really really good
coffee good eggs expectedly prepared as ordered
i asked for a side order of fresh for my sunny side up eggs and they came out nicely diced
i liked this restaurant the moment i walked in
it is spacious and clean and generates good energy
all the staff is aware of all the going ons in the restaurant as well as being super politely friendly
i will definitely come here again the next time i come to to vegas
the only minor minus is although they have separate restrooms their restrooms have only one stall
best thai food i have ever had
ended up going twice on my last trip to vegas
perfectly cooked medium rare filet and flaky tender pan seared salmon
very good service
overall an excellent meal for a very reasonable price
great service and great food
i didn't have anything that wasn't delicious
try the devil eggs
i was never really a seafood person but my friends have been telling to go try it out so i did
do not regret one bit our server's name was dianne she was wonderful
made us feel super welcomed with her bright smile
the food was amazing can't get enough of the sauce xd my overall experience was wonder
very authentic chinese hunan cuisine everything is good if you like real hunan food
this is really a hidden gem of chinatown
i hope everybody support real chinese food
i am proud of them although they don't have top busy business they are not compromise and making the americanized chinese food
the boss lady speaks very good english ask her for recommendation she does good job
the famous steam fish head is a hunan specialty but don't try it if you have problem with seeing fish head and can't deal with fine fish bones
if you have a skilled chinese friend to help you out you can enjoy the fish meat and soak your rice with the juice you will be amazed by the flavor
best ayce in vegas for low carb
rib eye appetizer and sibuya not fried
keep them coming great service too and the best sushi chef pedro
we recommend the beef wellington which is one of their specials
it is worth every dollar
the filet melts in your mouth
the puree had a perfect consistency
the selection of bread with volcanic sea salt makes your taste buds dance
we can't wait to go back
after planning my trip to vegas with my friends i knew earl of sandwich was my first pit stop i got the montague sandwich but my friend convinced me to try her hawaiian sandwich
at first i didn't think there was anything special about it
but i was so wrong the hawaiian sandwich had the perfect balance between sweet and savory
definitely a sandwich to try if you've already tried all the others
always coming back to this hotspot
love everything about this spot
what a cool concept too
maybe the pizza was bar none the best maybe i was drunk
but does it matter vegas is the perfect place for a secret pizza joint like this
loved it lunch was the best today and i didnt feel guilty at all eating my fill
because most items are pretty healthy
where have i been oyster bar gets a ton of great reviews from yelp some of my personal friends and even my own parents
just google las vegas pan roast and you get sent here to the oyster bar
there's so many yelp reviews about this place that my review is going to sound like a broken record
so i'll keep this one simple with bulletin points
service you read it and yes there's a wait
this is not because service is lacking
this is because the oyster bar only seats about 15 and the food is as good as it gets
service is actually good here
what takes a long time too is what i call linger eaters
these are people that take their sweet ol time to eat
the gf and i aren't linger eaters at all
however if we are going to wait over an hour to eat then we're going to take our time too
pan roast they're known for their pan roast
my gf got this and allowed me sample it
my goodness
everything that i read on these reviews were true
superb seafood jambalaya this is what i got
i haven't had jambalaya in years and was in that mood especially since the outside temps were dropping
overall
packed with mussels clams crab lobster shrimp and rice
your taste buds will be confused with what it's tasting but won't be confused whether it's good or not
my taste buds just voted
pretty damn good
clam chowder just about average but you don't come here for chowder
hours all day everyday prices you get what you pay for
most dishes are about or over 20
okay i didn't keep this review too simple
but it's still bulletin pointed
oyster bar is one of those places that you have to try at least once
yes the wait is long
and yes it's in a smokey casino
but if you're into gumbo jambalaya and overall good food then oyster bar is your place
yelp personal challenge 2013 497 500
just like fauchon in paris france not the hotel in vegas
bouchon in vegas has proven itself to me the company's true understanding of fine bakery patisserie
it could be as simple as a plain croissant and a cup of coffee
they know how to do it right
the melt in your mouth texture of the croissant had me go back to bouchon twice within the span of 3 hours
that good yes
also props to its convenient location just at the entrance to the adjoining sands expo center
a great quick stop to start off your full day at the conference convention etc with a lovely breakfast
also great for snacks and quick grab and go lunch fixes
now i just need to fly out to paris to revisit the exquisite fauchon
a diamond in the rough the freshest most spectacular seafood selection in all of las vegas
this place is exactly what fine dining is all about
we love the atmosphere the service the selection and the quality
it's a unique and adventurous treat
we are local las vegans and we usually avoid the strip like the plague and even on occasions when we've ventured down to splurge on some super luxurious high end restaurant we've been disappointed but we'd come down for rm seafood any day
we love their family dinner meals
we order the spicy orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp egg drop soup and we get the 6pcs crab rangoon as bonus items great delivery only 2 charge
thank you for wonderful hosts and wait staff
our waitress was amazingly attentive
through a whole playoff game
thanks guys
finally good dim sum in the lv
about freakin time it's located across from the buffet inside of rio
the food is good but the service is fantastic
i've seriously never had this level of service in any asian restaurant especially dim sum
my ice water never reached the half way point
they even came by and asked how i was doing and if there were any dishes that i would like to request
everyone there is super friendly and accommodating
another big shocker
their prices are super reasonable
our party of 4 indulged and our bill came to a whopping 72 which at similar places would have been well over 100
the food quality is very high
while i would love to give detailed descriptions of each dish as a white girl i have no idea what their proper names are
they do have a pretty decent selection of all of the standard fare and even some additional taro choices that are banging
dim sum isn't served all day long only 10a 3p
excellent thai food
always love coming here
the atmosphere is very cozy and family style and the staff always makes you feel welcome
my favorite thai restaurant in town
fellow yelpians let me take you on an adventure
i was walking with two of my chums stomach a growling looking for a place to chowdown when we spotted levy's
expecting it to be your everyday normal deli we went inside to look around
instantly i noticed the contemporary refined modest decor
various accolades filled the walls including best deli in vegas
instantly i knew this was no ordinary deli
after a perusal of the menu i noticed how low everything was priced
i ordered the cinnamon raisin cream cheese and fresh cut apple stuffed challah french toast chum 1 ordered a grilled mushroom and onion stuffed burger and chum dos had the classic reuben
a few short minutes later steaming delicious chow was brought to our table
i first noticed the extremely large portions
everyone had been given enough food to feed a pool full of hungry young hooligans
as we took our first bites a million orgasms erupted in my mouth
i was overcome with a rush of pure joy
upon tasting the other meals that were laid on our table i knew there was something quite special about this little deli
every bite was as good as the previous
the french toast was perfectly sweet with warm cream cheese crisp fresh apples and happiness bursting out of it
the bread was as light and fluffy as an angel's breast
the reuben was perfectly balanced and stuffed with delicious juicy meat almost overflowing out of it
the burger was as pure as any burger can possibly be
a beautiful meat flavor was pouring out of it that was only matched in tastiness by the crispy perfectly seasoned french fries
everything was literally perfect
on top of that the owner waiter was possibly the nicest man i have met in my many years on this wonderful planet
he helped at every possible turn giving us advice on what to order refilling drinks before we even knew they were empty
the cook well he was a cook of the gods
every piece of food in the establishment looked eternally tasty
the final amazing piece of amazingness all of this delicious food cost us under 30
i implore you my yelpians to visit levy's deli you will not be disappointed
sincerely your friendly neighborhood yelpmeister
this place is awesome the lunch menu offers many delicious meals at a cheap price 7
50 9 which includes a bowl of soup and potstickers the customer service is excellent
great smiles drinks were refilled without having to asked
they are very nice the place looks upscale too like any other thai restaurants
nice paintings comfy seats and clean tables just a nice place to dine
if you are staying in vegas strip this is only like 10mins
go there and check it out
you won't be disappointed
cons the place is kinda hidden
you may have to drive around in the parking lot to find it
they don't accept amex
i decided to try wicked spoon after hearing so many great reviews about it
we arrived quite early for our room at the vdara and my cousins from california were very hungry so i decided to take them out
wicked spoon is located on the upper floors of the cosmopolitan down a long and empty hallway
i think it's location away from the casino is what adds to the experience
now although pricey i expected it since it was on the strip
but that price does come with some of the best food i have had for a buffet since bacchanal
i really enjoyed that they already had the items pre portioned out for you that way you can kind of choose what items are your favorite and you aren't wasting any food
i live in the northern parts of las vegas and rc farms loves when people waste their food
i smell it all the time
you can tell that they took their time in creating the recipes for the food
their food is definitely a little more on the health conscious side
my favorite thing that i kept going back to was the smoked salmon
i absolutely loved the flavor profile of it
i would definitely recommend this to friends and family and will definitely be back if the situation presents itself
best meal ever jason and shane rock my daughter loved it when they took the crumbs off the tablecloth
very classy you will not be disappointed
tried this restaurant one afternoon off a tip of a friend
and now my girlfriend and i will literally schedule our vegas day around planet hollywood just to be close to earl of sandwich
i usually order the tuna melt and if you do the tabasco goes great with it
they usually have bottles at the tables too
i love the vibe the menu the scenery the windows overlook rehab lots of butts in bikinis for your viewing pleasure and especially the kale salad i stay at hard rock often so it's nice to have an option on the menu that's relatively healthy
the fried chicken got great reviews the burgers are delicious and the pretzels are yum but too much for 2 people
best for a table of 4
try the homemade popcorn for desert love it
great food nice atmosphere
awesome for breakfast or brunch with a selection of happy i
e pancakes waffles or healthy meals
i had the chicawafadopolis which was fried chicken tenders with buttermilk pancakes
the meal was delicious with the right portion size
one of the better meals we had in vegas
food and service were exceptional
wish i could remember our servers name great guy from greece who gave us some fab menu tips
i love it when a waiter will be honest if a menu item is over rated in their opinion
started with zucchini chips
paper thin zucchini fried and served with a tzatziki sauce and fried graviera cheese
marvelous my grilled octopus w capers and chickpeas melted in my mouth
greek salad salad was huge enough for 4 people
lamb chops were perfectly seasoned succulent and tender
the food is excellent but the wait can be long
get one of the pan roasts you won't be disappointed
dined at mastro's for a birthday dinner over the labor day holiday
overall come to mastro's for a superb fine dining experience on the strip
service 5 stars
our server mike was wonderful
he answered our many questions has excellent wine recommendations and accommodated our many requests all with a smile
he and the team also heard us discuss our friend's birthday and they brought out a special treat
food 5 stars
for an appetizer ordered the custom seafood tower which i highly recommend delicious
main dish char oreganata style
fish was cooked perfectly
also if ever ordering fish here do it oreganata style
has bread crumbs bacon pieces etc
soo good
dessert we all loved the chocolate sin cake
ambiance 5 stars
the layout look and feel makes it intimate yet spacious
if you're looking for authentic italian food and great scotch drinks
this is definitely the place to be the meatballs sausage and prosciutto are amazing
the caste iron pizza is a must try you won't be disappointed
the flavors in every dish compliment each other for a comfort food feeling
the pictures and lighting make tony's feel like you're at home around the family table talking to family and close friends
what a great meal ben treated us like family the ambiance music service and waiters were amazing we will definitely be back and we will be having our wedding ceremony reception at iac
ramen in vegas never thought to even search it up on yelp but stumbled upon it somehow
this is a cozy family like owned restaurant
the ramen soup base which is the essential part of ramen i think is delish
both my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our miso and soysauce ramen i've had ramen in hong kong and sf they're pretty good but this one hmm
i like even more
we're definitely going back for it and next time try their appetizer dishes
they look pretty interesting at other tables
i would say the food was very good
on par with one of my fave pub places in lv todd english's at aria and the thing that made it 5 stars was service
ate at the bar
very friendly but not overbearing staff and quick food
though quick the shrimp cocktail was crisp and cold and just enough bite in the sauce and the steak was done perfectly
the fingerling potatoes were a welcome small side to the good size steak
fed recommend if you are at caesars
visiting vegas for a few days and had a craving for thai
we ordered drunken noodles with shrimp pad thai tofu and pad prig pao plate with a side of yellow curry
everything was super delicious
first time i ever saw an egg net covering pad thai it was so cute innovative and delicious
next time i visit vegas i will definitely have a meal here
decor picking up our order was really nice and modern
very clean
aerrick was the bomb full of energy and fast with a smile
food was delicious margarita were made very well i will come back next time i am in town
fantastic food and great service
have been a regular customer of cracker barrel all over the country for decades now
i think it's safe to say that the experience here was one of best i've ever had considering the challenges of an opening day
yes the lines are very long
roughly 2 hour wait for a party of four but they quickly moved through the waiting list and kept us informed of our position
browsing the store is always a fun way to pass the time
lot's of cool items and snacks
staff were very friendly and attentive and service was top notch
the food was hot fresh and excellent quality for country fixins
all day breakfast is a plus and the chicken and dumplings are awesome
be prepared to leave stuffed
i am so glad to finally have a location in vegas
all the 1 star line complainers need to move along
don't get in line if you don't have the patience
if you love jose andres and you love meat then you'll love this place jose andres is one of my favorite chefs he had me hooked after eating at the bazaar at the sls in la several visits
i've also filled one of the seats at at the cosmo
amazing experience
eric was our server and the best one at that his wine recommendations were on point and he told us that what we ordered was plenty and we didn't need more
he was a waiter who knew the menu inside and out and can recommend to your heart's desire
amazing even though we were only a party of two we did order a quarter of the suckling pig
it was the most expensive pig i've ever purchased but it was darn good the skin was nice and crispy and we were able to get the back fat
you know the good stuff lol
i can't wait to go back and with more people so i can try more items
and i hope to get eric again as our server thank you for a wonderful experience eric you rock
carnevino is incredible
i was lucky to dine here for a work dinner so prices were not of importance and i'm thankful for that
it was the first time i had been to a restaurant tied in with a well known chef and i was not disappointed
i half expected a very standard meal but was blown away at the quality here
the bartenders and servers were very attentive and quick to help out
also happy to customize for you
we had a few that ordered martini's with special requests
i opted for an extra dirty martini which was delicious
i could have dined on the shrimp alla diavolo appetizer alone
the spice and tomato flavors matched perfectly with the huge shrimp
so delicious
the oysters were equally delicious
i had a tough time at dinner
i'm very picky about my steak and was unsure but went for it after all
i ordered it medium plus and it was just about perfect
but that was not the most memorable part
the person next to me ordered his steak blue
not knowing what that was i gave it a try and it was heavenly
a crisp char and raw inside reminded me of tuna steak
it's not something i ever imagined i would crave but i still remember the taste and texture to this day though stuffed we still opted for dessert and too many of them
the chocolate peanut butter torte was my favorite as well as the flourless chocolate cake
great spot
love eating here
it's worth the wait
advice call them a head how long the wait so you wouldn't be surprise when u get there
they have 2 location so call both and chose which one you prefers
the baguette cafe is one of my new weekend favorites for a breakfast sandwich or lunch time sandwich a coffee
the owners are french their cuisine is unmistakably so
it's nice to have a simple french bistro that is reminiscent of the croissant shoppes i visited in paris
vegas valley needs more quaint mom pop shops just like this
i am keeping this one on my repeat list
awesome
poke stack is great
the staff has been great and friendly
must stop
great atmosphere
kaya is awesome behind the bar
got our thai chicken pizza
awesome also
this is a must stop for scratch made food in vegas
one more edit
my wife becky just said this is the best pizza ever gotta try it
soooooooo gooooood first i would like to say that i recommend getting shrimp with medium spice because it gets real spicy after that
i recommend shrimp instead of crawfish because you get more bang for your buck and it is less work to get your meat
i went with a big group of people about 14 and they accommodated us really well
when you order your food it comes in a big plastic bag filled with the tastiest sauce and spices you could ever dream of
you have to un shell your shrimp or whatever else you order which may seem like a lot of work but once you take your first bite of this godly food you won't care anymore because any ounce of work is always worth that next bite
you get so much food so the price is worth it and you will not leave displeased
i have never been to louisiana but i imagine this is how it must be down there or if anything this might be better give it a try and you'll definitely want to come back
love this place vegetarian options vegan options and amazing staff
the brussel sprouts are divine
the curry califlower is sooo yummy
fresh refreshing waters abd drinks
aaand super affordable and healthy
too excited for my food to get here to get too detailed but this has to be the best place in town even though we're visiting from phoenix
last time we were here we were trying to figure out how to get a mr mamas in scottsdale as it's better than anywhere back home by a long shot
chiming in on the love for makai it's definitely fantastic and fast
i am a fan of the teriyaki chicken and mochiko wings for the tasty protein
add some brown rice and mac salad and or corn and a fabulous meal with all the ono food groups that makai is great at providing
the staff shares the aloha spirit with you the whole time and the price is right for what you get
i don't think i've ever ordered anything larger than the medium ono'er which gives you two choices of protein and two sides but that's enough for me and it's only 7
59 there's an upcharge if you get premium meats like steak and poke which i haven't
the only down side for us is that it's so far away from our house
if you're in the area stop by and try makai
amazing service and great sushi joan was really helpful on explaining how the menu works because it was our first time he also gave us really good service and i wouldn't hesitate to come back here because of that
10 10 would recommend
after 2 years in vegas i've finally found my go to mexican place you get great value for food here
complementary chips come with 2 salsas bean dip and roasted onion and peppers
most of the entrees come with a cup of fideo soup
if you're looking for a bit of a show get the fajitas which they flame tableside
be sure to stop in for happy hour sometime for great margaritas and good deal on beer
food offerings on hh special are prefect especially for cheese lovers go with the juan's sampler or juan's nachos to share for the table otherwise it'll end up being your dinner
i've also come in for brunch and their breakfast burrito offerings are excellent brunch meals even come with a beverage
food and atmosphere was great highly recommend
our server sam was very knowledgeable and accomodating
she was very busy but happy to be in the chaos
hard to find service like hers one of a kind
i would like to say that the staff knows customer relations management which is what all restaurant should understand
the server definitely took care of us
i don't get many good customer service in an asian restaurant so i really applaud to this one
ambience is good
looks clean
food was good
their fruit smoothies are really good
they have i think over 100 flavors
i can't remember
plenty of parking spots
no need to worry about parking
located at the smiths shopping center
great spot for the midnight sub
conner was super friendly and made a great sandwich
great time great prices so much fun great happy hour specials food is amazing karaoke prices for a private room are amazing and 50 off during happy hour
best jasmine green milk tea in town therefore the 4 star rating other then that id give this place a 1 or 2 start based on everything else i hate coming here this plaza is always packed
their service is a little slow at times to be honest they either need to hire more people or get more equipment and or expand the store due to how small it is inside cause dam they can be s l o o o o w
was expecting a good meal but it was so well prepared that i enjoyed every single bite
the grilled vegetables were loaded with flavor
the mashed potatoes were made with yellow gold potatoes and were a total delight
the filet mignon was done to perfection
my tastebuds were dancing with happiness
what an interesting place the feel of the restaurant is young and hip and the vibrant green of the decor makes the place feel fun and eclectic
this is my first time here even though i often go next door and hit up starbucks
the menu is rather large and it will take you minute to read everything over
they are gluten free vegan vegetarian and low carb friendly place that offers a nice selection of soups salads burgers 9 pizzas smoothies sandwiches wraps and a choice to even create your own meal
after pondering what to eat i decided on a burger
what is more classic than a burger and if they could make it right then i would be encouraged to try more off the menu
i ordered the buffalo burger done to a medium they also have ostrich which i have never had and tofu fries
there is also an option for the jicama fries
i was told the jicama fries are fry shaped pieces of jicama tossed in a dressing
i shied away from the jicama because i have not had it before personally but i did hear they are good
the tofu fries are firm tofu tossed in rice flow and fried
they are delicious the burger can come on a wheat or gluten free bun or as a wrap
i chose the wheat bun and got swiss cheese on my burger
the burger itself is massive stacked with a thick patty lettuce tomato and onion i can barely fit it in my mouth the bread to meat ratio for the burger is perfect
i took a bite and the burger is done exactly right medium juicy and tender
for my buffalo burger tofu fries pickle and a soda cost me a little over 14 including tax
a good price for a nice buffalo burger
also their soda machine dispenses small ice pellets
this is an important point to make for my fellow ice munchers the place is wifi ready but you will have to ask for the passkey to access the network
when i asked the staff about power access they did not know but i was able to speak to jeff one of the owners and he was able to show me where to plug in
for those needing a place to work there are a ton of plugs long power strips under the bench along the back wall of the restaurant
just a little looking and you will see them
if you are looking for a nice place to grab a healthy bite to eat even with your gf vegan or uber health conscious friends then look no further than the greens and proteins
great place outside the strip open 24 hours a day
awesome pho
their chicken wings with the kim long sauce is really good too
there's always a crowd waiting but the wait is never more than a few minutes
highly recommend this spot
i love this restaurant best sushi in town
let me tell you i cannot eat sushi
if it's from yama sushi then no problem
very fresh casual and great customer service
olives is really pretty amazing
i had the foie gras appetizer and the duck confit pasta and both were amazing
watching the fountain during dinner was just an added plus
i would recommend you get reservations and ask for a window with a good view
i actually didnt have a reservation they initially said 30 min but they actually sat us in 5
the bread with the olive tapenade to start is also pretty stellar
great service and food what more could i say
our waitress danielle was awesome she kept a smile on her face and made sure we was satisfied
an amazing irish pub
definitely come later in the evening not on a monday
the food and alcohol is great but the ambience isn't complete without an irish band playing
this place has such amazing customer service the owner and the cook provides such a good atmosphere
the food was realllllly good and reaaally fresh i will definitely be coming here again
we loved our first experience at pink great service awesome 2 for 1 caronas and s lovely selection of 3 salsas w your chips we ordered the chicken nachos
they were huge perfect for two great atmosphere cute girl servers great food we will defiantly be back
tried this place out due to yelp reviews and was pleasantly surprised
we ordered the new yorker which was my favorite
also ordered the marguerita which was also good
we tried the meatballs which weren't bad but wouldn't say it really stood out
good food and great service also parking is free at the grand after validation
i used to avoid this place like the plague
a while back i ordered cheesesticks and the lovey got a meat filled pizza i'm vegetarian
those were the nastiest cheesesticks i've ever tasted
straight up like chemicals had been sprayed all over it
however the beloved swears by it and when he told me has was going tonight i decided to give them another try
and i'm so glad i did i ordered the vegetable vegetarian pizza
i ordered pan style crust and on the menu it comes with cheese mushroom tomatoes spinach onions and artichoke hearts with a substitution of creamy garlic sauce instead of traditional red pizza sauce
i ordered it without artichoke and added black olives and feta cheese
sooooo good they have a special on tuesdays today that most large pizzas are 10 dollars
the bread crust tasted so fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings the best part was the creamy garlic sauce
i love garlic and this had perfect flavor and only took about 12 minutes to cook at home
i swore this place off but i will be becoming a regular customer
went in expecting good desserts and ate some of the best food we had in vegas
grilled chicken panini and turkey burger were wonderful
i could not wait to go to this restaurant for chocolate and by the time i finished our meal i was in the mood for cheese cake instead
it was very good
my husband's peanut butter sundae was delicious
they are always so friendly
the food oh don't get me started on the food
it's great and such awesome portions
i like coming here because i can take home the extra for my lunch tomorrow
they even change my favorite dish to accommodate my allergies
cool breakfast spot in southern highlands everyone is nice and the pj's are a great touch
good food tastes fresh great for families and children
request amanda she is friendly and polite great service definitely one of my favorite places to eat
awesome food fantastic waiter and my favorite mini hot wings ever def
get the hot wings if your a fan they are tiny with shaved bone handles so yumny
the sides were also great risotto and brocalini
the place is closed down and most of the interior has been removed
bum deal one of the best taco places in town
one of my must go to places when i'm in vegas
loves flat iron steak rib eye chinois salad
this place is amazing
i took my mom for lunch and we had great food and the staff was wonderful
can't wait to go again
great customer service from one of their employees
food was warm and so delicious
yummy yummy
i've been here on a few occasions and have enjoyed the ramen
4 stars for the usual ramen choices
4
5 stars for the shiyo or salt ramen
most places don't do the salt ramen and those that do usually over salt to the point of not wanting it anymore
while not as good as i've had in multiple cities in japan
it was delivered with the greatest enjoyment i've had stateside
service was great
line out the door busy
still having polite service with perfect presentation
simply amazing i randomly found them one day and have been searching for them ever since
can't wait to randomly find them again some day
one of my favorite places for lunch went for lunch today with my roomie
she had the beef stew
tasted it and it was really flavorful and beefy
i had the light club sandwich which had a hearty portion of turkey and ham on it with side of fresh fruit that's served with a sweet delicious yogurt and a cup of the vegetarian vegetable soup
soup was ok i usually get the chicken pot pie soup which is absolute bliss
we have ordered from here multiple times and have never been disappointed
most recently we ordered chicken fried rice buddhas feast veggie lo mein egg rolls cashew chicken and kids sweet and sour chicken
our total for all of this was 40 and we ordered it as carry out
i have never tried the delivery
we had enough food for leftovers
the food was hot and there was plenty of it
not salty and not greasy
one of my favorite things about this place is their use of fresh veggies
the dishes don't just contain book choy and onions
there are big pieces of fish broccoli mushrooms carrots etc
the egg rolls are actually egg rolls not spring rolls
the cashew chicken also had plenty of whole cashews
i'm actually surprised this place has only 3 stars overall
i've tried many chinese places in vegas and this one is by far the best in my opinion
for this most recent order my whole family loved everything and plans to make this the go to restaurant for chinese food
giadas is a first class spot
one of the best experiences i've ever had
we decided to compromise
we would have an appetizer and dessert at gs and shake shack after
we ordered the parmesano reggiano with honey infused with sage
for dessert we had the leaning tower of espresso
it was so amazing
our waiter told us to give it a moment before eating the dessert and i know now why
but the best most awesome part of our experience was the small loaf of bread you get to start
it's in a small personal dutch oven type of dish
it was sooooo good
it comes with 2 breadsticks and two cheese crisps
there is pesto olive oil to spread on the bread or the lemon marscapone
omg now that is good stuff
overall this place was top dog
i would love to have a full experience next time i'm in town
well done giada well done
and guess what shake shack is not as good as in and out
i live right upstairs and come in almost every day but this weekend seemed to stand out
what a great staff they always remember you
and food is phenomenal there's a market attached too that delivers to tenants could use better advertising
we dined on a monday w an 8 pm reservation
we were offered an opportunity to have drink at the lounge or just be seated
the restaurant was a little over half full the entire time we dined and the atmosphere was lively
people wore a range of dressy to semi casual clothing i would recommend more on the dressy side
for two we shared the tuna over crispy rice wagyu usa brussles sprouts and bacon fried rice
everything was melt in your mouth delicious
we would have ordered one more entree to share had we been hungrier but we had an early evening snack prior
plan for 1 2 hours for dinner
ours was leisurely
service was spot on from the moment we entered til left
i got spaghetti with meatballs and my friend got lisa v pasta
dayummmm portions are small but after finishing my dish i'm perfectly full
flavor is just right noodles are not soft but a bit chewy
i can seriously eat another one in a few minutes
it's that good my hot server was on top of her game checking on us every 5 8 minutes to make sure we're okay
food and service was perfect
great family owned restaurant
food is amazing
prices affordable
and the staff is very friendly
amazing food
i highly recommend the burger we visit from san diego and make sure to always stop by for lunch
carnevino is a great steakhouse at a great property in las vegas
i was suggested this place by a good friend and it lived up to the hype
all courses were excellent from the calamari to their in house made peanut butter in the peanut butter torte everything was spot on i had the new york strip which was bone in and prepared just right
the meat near the bone was very flavorful and the waiter encouraged me to pick it up and eat off the bone caveman style my girl ordered the filet which i had to try on principal
the cut was also flavorful and melted in your mouth
for sides we had the mashed potatoes which comes with a fried egg folded in to the dish the eggplant and brussel sprouts
all of which added a great and flavorful compliment to the meat
finally the dessert was an unexpected cap to a great meal so i highly suggest trying to peanut butter torte
our server was julio and his helper was michelle i believe both very knowledgable and added to a great experience
also one must remember this is an italian steakhouse so they also serve many pasta dishes and other meats like veal and lamb
that said the cuts of beef may seem limited compared to other places
overall i put carnevino on the same level with any other steakhouse in vegas
thanks matt
i had a great experience here joined a friend for lunch one day
i love the atmosphere it's very contemporary with interesting light fixtures and clean lines reminding me of a bistro i could run across in san francisco seattle or new york
yes that's what i'm looking for vegas the service we received was excellent
our waiter was entertaining without being overbearing friendly informative and prompt
my only complaint is a noticeable lack of options for vegetarians
i will repeat again and again what so many others have
the chicken curry soup is to die for basically like sipping a cup of perfectly seasoned cream but in a good way i promise
oh
divine
the turkey burger was a real turkey burger freshly made from ground turkey and seasoned well
the veggie medley was delicious perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned
i considered getting that soup and another side or two for a meal next time because i enjoyed it so much everything we had was well cooked well seasoned and generous portions
absolutely a perfect date spot
i can't wait for an excuse to return
every single thing we had was absolutely delicious we enjoyed a caesar salad adult taster tots filet peppercorn sauce was amazing and lobster tail
not to mention the delicious jelly filled donut holes for dessert
our server vince was great too
db has the best burger ever yes is it 32 but worth every last penny
some people are complaining that the prie fixe wasn't all that great
well they should've bit the bullet and spent a little more on something that's actually worth the price
why would you go to a nice restaurant and order from the prie fixe menu it's like walking into louis vuitton on rodeo and asking to see the items on sale
you simply cannot prepare yourself for the overwhelming taste and vision of a restaurant of this magnitude
my review will reflex my state of mind after my meal speechless
we were here on a saturday afternoon and had lunch
the food was good and the service was awesome
shannon at the bar is the best
great food great service at a reasonable price for on the strip
their calamari was probably some of the best i've ever eaten the prosciutto pizza was really good too it's definitely worth a trip to the mgm
mmmm
i love crepes and we decided on la creperie at paris hotel for lunch during this past labor day vegas trip
we both ordered savory crepes since it was for a quick lunch
we had one st
louis which had imported ham mozzarella cheese topped with fresh basil with bechamel sauce
and one bayonne which had imported prosciutto mozzarella cheese topped with fresh basil and bechamel sauce
the wait time was around 20min
but these are all made to order and they were delicious the ham was smokey sweet and savory and went perfectly with the crepe
definitely coming back here when we come back to vegas
i was celebrating my birthday on saturday liked the design of the restaurant the service was very good and the food came very fast the dessert was the best i ever eat the food was very tasty
thank you i will come back very soon
this is the best in n out burger in las vegas
i have never been to in n out where they have a host that takes my tray and fills my drink
i mean who does that at a fast food restaurant
go off the strip divey neighborhood attached to the sapphire men's club separate entrance make the trip we were in vegas over easter and ate here twice wish we would have found it sooner we would have eaten there every meal
they are open 24 7 and have great breakfast
had the chilaquiles awesome had the carnitas street tacos awesome husband had the huevos rancheros awesome the salsa was soo good
miss it now thinking about it
maybe a 7 hour round trip
exllent order of orange blossom seafood udon chick bowl kids love rolls speciall
the uni udon here is a must try the miso carbonara udon is also very good i would also highly recommend the mental rice bowl
i have never been disappointed here
delicious fresh fancy and highly recommended staff is welcoming and conversational
awesome atmosphere old vegas style fun neon lights fun colored sugar
we went for breakfast food was great
must have been a dozen egg omelette fresh and home cooked
it was very busy and all the staff was nice and prompt
i highly recommend it not over priced
i see no reason to not just give 5 stars
my friend who was wary about getting a steak said it was the best he has had in a long time
thumbs up
this place is amazing i come here all the time
their employees are awesome they get you served quickly and their delivery is fast and food is always hot and fresh
went there after recovering from a long night at edc and didn't want to wait for a long line at a buffet or restaurant
super bomb pizza for my tasting and definitely good size slices for the price
customer service was awesome especially with nikki sorry if misspelled as she was very polite and answered some questions about cool things in the area
atmosphere was very laid back as there was also a tv to watch the game
definitely reccomend and probably will return
i can't get enough of their fish tacos and they're pretty consistent
if ever you get a chance you should check out their tortilla soup
seriously my new favorite place to eat hands down we have eaten there a few times now and i can not complain at all about the food or service can't wait to have my birthday catered
i have been here 4 times
it is on top of my list of restaurants to visit whenever i visit vegas
there is always a line so expect to wait but it is completely worth it the service is great
they have a super friendly waitstaff who are really knowledgable about their menu and drinks
every time i've been i've only gotten breakfast so i have no idea how their lunch or dinner is
their food has huge portions but every bite is delicious
i've had their pancakes chicken and waffles hash eggs benedict and sampled many other dishes that the people i came with ordered
everything was delicious
if you've never been this is definitely one of the places you need to go you won't regret it
great food and awesome waiter waitress
definitely a must try place if you crave for mini hot pot while in town
wow what an epic meal hubs and i came here for ayce sushi dinner and had to be rolled out
speaking of rolls my only regret is not being able to try all of them
the rolls all sounded so good and they were so creative with naming them menu items like burning your ass and the playboy special
fun we only tried 2 rolls out of maybe 100 varieties because there were only 2 of us and the rolls were about 8 pieces each
we ordered the cowboy special since there was a cowboy convention this weekend in vegas and the big easy
i really really wish i had my ayce sushi buffet loving family of piggies back home in toronto with me for this so we'd be able to try everything this was definitely the best ayce sushi dinner i've ever had
mind you i have no basis of comparison for the other ayce sushi places in nevada but i've probably eaten almost all of them back home in the greater toronto area there are a lot of them there and this one is no comparison
the quality of the fish was excellent for an ayce and they even had premium items on the menu like tobiko uni amaebi beef tataki and oysters
sure you were limited to 1 order 2 pieces per person of these premium offerings but kudos for putting them on the menu in the first place
we ate mostly off the nigiri and appetizer sections of the menu because of the small sizes and wanting more variety to try different things
we also tried all of the special sashimi all yummy i loved that even their simple sushi was not simple
it wasn't simply a piece of fish slapped on top of rice
oh no the fish was first perfectly seasoned then placed on the rice i
e
garlic tuna sushi soooo good
also liked that their 1 serving portions were small so you were able to try different things
i'm sure it wasn't easy making a dish with only 3 little baby octopuses on it
they could have piled more on in one serving forcing you to be full on less items making it easier for the chefs
and each item came out fresh and piping hot too
almost forgot to mention they have ice cream mochi in the dinner dessert menu i love ice cream mochi drool only downside was only 1 per person we tried the green tea and mango
both were excellent
might have to drop in one more time before i leave sin city
this might seem like a weird comment but in ayce sushi places in toronto its quite common that you put in an order and it doesn't come out so you order again and all of a sudden you get double your order
ok this time i am done
everyone that works at this establishment was amazing
from the sweet hostess who was willing to help with anything needed to our perfect waiter scott you can't go wrong coming here
the food is amazing the service is immaculate the drinks are wonderful
go here and get what you paid for
what a great night with the fam
jack cooked us up some incredible steak and mahi mahi with orange sauce
wow jack is the taipan chef and is wonderful and nice
mel is a great server so attentive and courteous my kids love them
the new owner is very nice young and very eager to keep this place successful
love coming here
i love this cute theme lunch spot
no matter what your in the mood for they have something that will satisfy your craving
holy moly why is this place not all over the place i read the reviews but hot this place deserves more then what i can give for a rating i knew i was going to save this for lunch the day before leaving vegas
it was worth the anticipation and still days later i can't get it off my mind i ordered the be my valentine's deal 60 all the roll options 1 2 shrimp lobster crab for 2 and 2 cups of clam chowder with a side of pure lobster tail solo
2 soda pops went with the blueberry lemonade every bite was drenched in flavor i started with the crab it lit my eyes so bug with its bursting flavors 2nd to go down was the lobster and it did not disappoint
small seating area meant to get in and out
rainy days prob won't work best here but if you are here and on this side of the strip its worth it for lunch dinner or even a quick small snack this place is a gem ready for you to come on over
mmmmm great mexican food
good portions and a friendly staff
we had the nachos and quesidillas
all great definitely coming back here viva las vegas
my parents took my daughters and me here for dinner on mother's day
the food here is so very good the portions are very big
we had the mussels and chicken wings for the girls as appetizers
the mussels were perfectly cooked not tough or chewy
plus the portion was very large for the price
if you ordered this dish on the strip you would easily pay triple the amount at least
ask for extra bread to mop up the amazing sauce that's on the mussels
the flavor is unbelievable
the chicken wings were very flavorful too
we also had chicken parmigiana baked ziti chicken francese and a pizza
all very delicious and again ample portions
you will bring home leftovers
try this place
you won't be disappointed
on a side note my parents have been back several times since the mothers's day visit and my mother really likes one of the desserts the italian cheesecake
they went on a sunday and they were out
my mother told the owner that they were coming back to eat there for their anniversary which was just a few days away he told her he would have it for her
when they returned a few days later he was true to his word and had the italian cheesecake for her
very nice family run restaurant
such a great breakfast brunch spot
our waitress ashley was excellent
so knowledgeable courteous and attentive
she also kept us from ordering more then one of the biggest pancake i've ever seen
haha
ashley made our experience a special one
wow
the food was so good
the service was excellent
and our waitress even helped us pick out dishes we'd enjoy
we'd never been there before so the extensive menu where we could pick any dish because everything is vegan was a little intimidating
but she was spot on with her suggestions and my husband and i both loved the food
can't wait to go back when we're in vegas again
what a great little place to have right down the street the gelato is so delicious and so many creative flavors to choose from
my three year old loves tasting them all
even the adventurous flavors like red pepper
we go at least once a week or so and the staff is always very friendly and welcoming
would highly recommend art of flavors to anyone
favorite restaurant
food comes in seriously less than 5 min
best place to eat seafood
i love the alaskan king crab legs they are amazing
we have eaten at several locations and all of them are amazing
laughlin the golden nugget overlooking the river and in ventura ca
dean was our server and he was the man
been here a couple times and they've always been great
good food good service
this place never fails and always hits the spot
price wise i've only been here for happy hour after midnight
steaks are 2 legit to quit med rare rib inyo eye with mac n cheese side
i have mention their drink menu is the best ive seen
other good mentions are the clams root beer float doughnuts yes dough deez nuts and you can't go wrong with an old fashioned
boom you're welcome
please do yourself a favor and come here on your next vegas trip we made a reservation on opentable at 9 pm for 2
when we got there i asked for patio seating because from other reviews i read the view of the fountains of the bellagio was a must
they told me it could be about a 30 minute wait but to our surprise we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated
the outdoor patio seating was worth it while enjoying your food not only can you feel the rush of the vegas strip you can watch the bellagio fountains show as well as live entertainment from artists playing on the strip
this night we got lucky that a saxophonist was playing nearby which added to the whole ambiance and experience
for food options i decided to order the caramelized sea scallops with the asparagus snap peas and the minted pea
i ate everything single thing on the plate it was that good
also my boyfriend ordered ratatouille and i have never tried so what better place to do so than here
it was also very appetizing
nice location for a nice romantic dinner
i normally like thin noodle
noodle at ramen kobo is not thin it means not my favorite but it was so yummy and i loved it i tried tonkotsu ramen and the broth was so creamy and thick
you should add egg it's super good
so let me start off by saying
amazing
this place hits the spot for any noodle craving
both my friends had soups
one had pork and shrimp udon and bun bo he which is a medley of meats
they loved it i had charbroiled chicken vermicelli and let me tell you i almost cried tears of joy
i didn't even mention the authentic vietnamese iced coffee and spring rolls
when in vegas and having noodle cravings
go here
great food
all you can eat for 26
00
cool little spot
staff is very attentive
definitely coming back here to try more stuff on the menu
hands down best ever they treat you like fam and they make our classics the best
food 5 5 customer service 5 5 clean 5 5 most welcoming spot to go to for family style meals and good vibes
best deal of delicious food drinks plus outstanding customer service we ate there almost every day during our 2 week stay in vegas
everything about the place is an a
a special shout out to bar tender's cassie and christina
i love the way they made my almond joy martinis
see you all again next year
our experience about that restaurant
we had a dinner last night
our server named michael he was terrific know exactly what you need and what you want we had an excellent food taste such a good experience
our server michael was smiling all the time we have been there
we enjoyed very much his company we do recommend that place to anyone good chinese food taste different than others restaurants thank you so much we enjoyed our time
awesome food we are from texas and like it hot they completely satisfied our desire for crawfish
and it was
just amazing to have a bakery able to offer gluten free and dairy free deliciousness
i'm so glad you exist thank you
came to a conference in las vegas and had a late lunch here
irma was our server and she was great the food was so good
i ordered for delivery and by far this is one of the best thai i have tasted and the hot spice level was perfect for the number i picked
i will now be a frequent flyer
came here for lunch today and i am a believer the cafe is extremely clean and well laid out
plenty of items to choose from
i had a tree of life pita honeydew cucumber juice
my bf ordered the same thing
our food came out fast was a very generous portion
and tasted so fresh and tasty service was also very friendly and fast
love this place and will def be back
the amazing pizza at secret pizza gives me reason alone to come to vegas and i look forward to stopping by after a trip to the dayclub or a night out during every visit
the pizza is incredibly close if not better than the pizza in new york with a thin but chewy crust melty cheese and quality toppings
line gets pretty gnarly so expect a wait but luckily since it's just fast food it tends to move pretty fast
with our support last night to pacquiao may's fight we decided to eat out and i happened to choose this one since it was closer to my work area
oh yeah i am so in love with this pizza restaurant
i love the decor inside the music they played on their big screen was my kind of music
it is somewhat like a fine dining but it can be casual too
but the most part i was sold to this place was their new yorker pizza
it is so delicious
mind you i really don't like pizza with so many sauce on top of it because i can't handle it but this one was really different
i did enjoyed my slice and i totally forgot the taste of the sauce
also this place is a great place to bring all my friends and relatives from out of state to dine in
pizza was expensive 33 for 16 inches but it's okay for i am so loving this place
ok now officially my new favorite buffet in vegas
i am a seafood lover though
so i'm definitely biased
i think i ate a pound of salmon sashimi
and my hubby ate his fill of crawfish and oysters
also the clam chowder was delicious
legit one of my fav spots to eat
anyplace that can offer me unencumbered chicken skin gets an a in my book
this is a great spot to sample a little bit of this and a little bit of that which is how i personally like to roll pork belly chicken thighs chicken skin and bacon wrapped asparagus
i think i wanna be buried here
yeah
thats right its that good i drive all the way from centennial hills just to get some of this deliciousness i will most certainly be back to kyara
this place was great i'm not much of a drinker but i did have one of their well known margaritas and i was not disappointed at all
it was a bit pricey for a mexican restaurant but it is also considered upscale whatever that means
this is vegas we're talking about
i've been there a few times and the fajitas beef or chicken are a force to be reckoned with
the seasoning they use on the meat is very unique
the beef almost has a sweet flavor to it that i believe though i can't be certain is orange flavored
it's nothing you'd expect but definitely something you'll enjoy they also have an array of deserts if that is your cup o tea but the best way to spend your time and money while in la isla is on the actual meal
enjoy friends regards cfc
we ordered the lgtbq the tree of life pita the what what for the kids vegan blueberry cheesecake watermelon chia juice and honeydew q cumber juice
while i didn't enjoy the watermelon juice it's delicious just not for me
best pad thai i have had i had level four and it was hot but good
made me sweat
great spot on fremont
this is definitely going to be my new favorite restaurant we went today for the first time because we were craving pho and dumplings
and being that i'm vegan and hubby is a great sport at accompanying me on vegan adventures this place sounded perfect
not only were the pho and dumplings the best vegenation has the best fruit topped french toast complete with this sweet dipping sauce the service is also great art was our waiter and he made us feel very comfy
he knew it was our first time visiting and we liked how attentive he was with us
we must have sounded like a broken record we kept repeating how amazing everything tasted the mango tea was very refreshing especially for a hot day in july i really can't wait to come back and try the other drinks
the overhead music was also on point it was dope to hear odezsa sbtrkt and disclosure while i was munching away
add a real awesome ambience to the mix and you have heaven right in downtown vegas
one last thing i love the art they have one of a pig with the words friend not food added on it
love i can't wait to go back
i'm still tinged and can honestly eat that pho every day
and the dumplings
and french toast
let me start by saying i don't eat red meat
i know it's weird since this is a high end steakhouse but my experience was beyond expectations
my meal included oysters grilled octopus mushroom pasta and branzino
there are fancy names on the menu but i can't remember them
the best thing i had was the grilled octopus
my wife had the chicken and a side of tuscan fries both exceptional
also the starter bread was tasty
they were little parm
donut holes so good
one very minor thing many people at our table didn't like the lard based spread for the bread
it's a non issue because they give you a second option a garlic delicious spread
service was fantastic
the waiter was extremely knowledgeable
i always love it when 10 servers set down everyone's main dish at once
this is a must visit restaurant
i love this place i'm grateful that the prices are super reasonable for a custom pizza
this would be a good place to take a group of people
came here with 3 other friends and were seated immediately
had greg and a woman i forgot her name as our servers in the lounge by the bar
the food was absolutely amazing
had the admiral's feast and it was so delicious
the service here was also great both the staff were very attentive and very friendly
will definitely be coming back soon

one of the best breakfasts i've had in a long time
i ordered the biscuits and gravy i had more than enough and it was so delicious this is definitely one of my top breakfast restaurants ill be eating at
fantastic crepes
arrived at 9 quickly got a seat and checked out the menu
we shared a savory crepe egg sausage followed by a sweet nutella strawberries bananas
both were gluten free and both were amazing
talked to the owner a bit mainly about the bucket of nutella they used and she told us about how nutella will soon be distributing their magic chocolate elixer in piping bags in addition to jars
the food and ambiance were so good we went back the next day
got there around 10 and it was packed we were lucky to find two available seats
by the time we finished there were about 12 people in line waiting for a seat
on this trip i had the elvis bacon peanut butter caramel and banana
yum for those that are gluten intolerant they really really really try to keep their gluten free food gluten free and you can watch every step of the process
however the woman running the gluten free bakery next door who's celiac said that they aren't perfect and she can't eat here
i suspect it depends on how much gluten you can withstand odds are there's very very little included but this place wouldn't be certified gluten free
i avoid gluten but am not celiac so this was fantastic
pan asian is probably my favorite all around thai restaurant in las vegas
the prices are reasonable for the quality of food produced
although they don't quite have the selection as lotus of siam they have all the classics
my personal favorite is the stir fried linguini which comes with your choice of meat asparagus tomatoes and a spicy kick there's no mild version
other favorites like pad thai and pad see yew are just as good
i love that the noodles are actually cooked to perfection instead of the typical half assed versions that stick together at some other thai joints
i also really enjoyed the dw fried rice if you're not feeling any of the noodle dishes
their level of spiciness rates on a scale of 1 10 so if you're a first timer i highly recommend starting low even a 3 is a bit too much for some people
i've always had a great meal here
i've even catered through pan asian they take large orders up to a day prior
they also have lunchtime specials on the weekdays
tried this place today for the first time
i had the curry chicken and my boyfriend had jerk chicken
both were excellent
also had the meat patty
so good
we will definitely be back
if you know me i love my pizza
so much that i had to give it up for lent but that didn't stop me this weekend
forgive me
location it's literally hidden
just take the escalators to the third floor
then you'll find this long hallway once you reach the end you'll be there food it was soo good i had the white pie
next time i'm going to bring a whole box home with me haha
customer service they were all friendly offered their recommendations
so overall food experience 5 5
authentic chinese food at the strip
reasonably priced i can actually say that it is very affordable considering it is inside the venetian casino
the shumai siomai or simply pork dumplings it is just so delicious
i had to order 2 every time cause it is jusy so damn good
the fried rice is a good portion i can say it is good for 2 people
my husband had the beef brisket soup noodle and it is just like being in china
this place is one place u would always come back to
one day we ate there twice
for lunch and dinner just can't get enough of noodle asia and oh did i mention that service is fast
they have about 5 or 6 cooks in the cooking station and they make it right away so it is yummy and hot when served
the indian food on the east side of town is great but it's awesome to finally have great indian food in the southwest too
great experience at bar
food was great but bar staff was amazing and made our visit really enjoyable
they were all accommodating i ordered an off menu cocktail which came out perfect and without making me feel bad for doing it and friendly
bartenders were all engaging and sincere felt like drinking in neighborhood bar
my boyfriend is restaurant manager with 25 experience and when he is happy with service i know it is good
beary deliciousness this diner is the perfect breakfast spot
you forget the craziness of vegas the second you pull up
the hostesses are all very friendly and the waiters are polite and well knowledges about the menu
this family atmosphere is unparalleled throughout vegas
now onto the food
even better i ordered some of the fresh squeezed orange juice and wow was it fresh
not something i'd expect to find in vegas but i saw them personally squeeze it and i was amazed
it was quite the compliment to the food
i ordered the joe's hobo omelette
stuffed with a bunch of meat along with onion and spinach
the eggs were cooked perfectly and the omelette was so tasty
i ordered the red potatoes as a side which weren't as crispy as i liked but still very good
i would definitely recommend trying this omelette
finally the best part the pancakes
the other two people i ate with ordered the pancakes and couldn't shut up about them so i had to try
one sweet delicious bite led to about 15 more
they were hands down the best pancakes i've ever had
so thick and they melted in your mouth along with the syrup that tasted like it came straight from a log cabin
the pancakes are a must try i'm serious if you're looking for a breakfast to start your day off right stop looking and drive here immediately
you will not regret it i can promise you that
enjoy
finally tried their banh mi today and by far the best in vegas
authentic strong vietnamese coffee
i am a fan
this place has been called the best thai restaurant in north america
i'm not sure how this was determined but the food is pretty delicious
and yes you can get many items veganized here the ala carte menu is a great place to get some veggie and or tofu combinations from pad prik king to chili mint to green curry one of my faves
just be sure to tell them no fish sauce and ask about which curry bases are ok
sometimes red curry is made w shrimp paste
the spicy vegetable soup is amazing and lives up to it's name the phrase i can't feel my lips anymore but i can't stop eating this is commonly uttered
you can actually get a few delicious dessert options here too sticky rice w mango coconut ice cream made w coconut milk ftw fried bananas
all delish
bonus they have albarino and stone ipa on their drink menu so i get my choice of two of my favourite bevvy's to complete my meal
they have recently expanded and about doubled their seating capacity so it's easier than it used to be to get a table too i would recommend a reservation on a fri or sat
but if it's packed you can always trot over to komol for some excellent chow as well
i will say this though i have been vegan about 7 years and don't stray from that
i also generally try to encourage others to eat in a similar manner
however when i take meat eaters to lotus i pretty much insist that they order off the northern thai menu
only one item on there doesn't have meat but the dishes are very rarely found on american thai menus
so just go for it already if you're an adventurous eater you'll probably love it
we have been coming here for 5 years now and absolutely love it
food is always great and service as well
weekends can be quite a wait but worth it
haven't been disappointed with a single meal
so in my deprived life i have never been to a vegas buffet on the strip
every time i go we end up eating somewhere else
so this time around we were staying at caesar's and decided to try the buffet on our last day
it looked so nice from the outside
we went for brunch which cost 50 bucks i was pretty surprised at the price tag but i learned that this was the norm
luckily there was no line when we went so added bonus the shock of the price tag quickly left my head once we were inside
the buffet is huge they had a section for dessert american italian asian omelet bar and pancake waffle station
i did not know where to start but after a night of drinking i really wanted some pho and they had it not only that but the pho was pretty good
actually everything i tasted was pretty yummy
i mean buffet food has that reputation of being sub par but every dish was delish
i would love to come back here and splurge for dinner thank you bacchanal for making my first vegas buffet experience awesome
these outlets are better than the south premium outlet mall
it's outdoors so keep that in mind for summer but the shops are higher end than the south outlet mall
there is burberry dolce and gabbana kate spade etc
food options isn't that great but there is a cheesecake factory
by comparison the south outlet trust me i go there all the time cos i live nearby also has nicer shops but aren't as high end
there is a coach michael kors but you can find all that and more in the north outlet anyway
the plus side is the south outlet is indoors a little cramped and dark though in my opinion and has more food options around the area
both have great sales going on all the time
either way i'd choose the north outlet if you want a nicer experience and the south outlet if you don't care if it's a little dingier and just want to shop
this is actually one of the coolest and nicest places to eat in vegas on the strip that won't break the bank
the peppermill is sort of a las vegas landmark and staple having been here since the 70s it was even used in the movie casino
the peppermill is still all original inside with it's cool and almost star wars and guardians of the galaxy like futuristic lighting and funky neon colors
the staff are extremely attentive and very very nice and welcoming the wait times aren't ever really that long and the staff does their best to seat you as fast as possible
the food here is absolutely amazing and ranges from your breakfast staples like pancakes which i highly recommend to dinner favorites like steak or wings
the prices here are also what's a huge selling point for this place as peppermill really isn't all that pricey despite being a stones throw from the strip
i ordered the pancakes and got 3 massive pancakes literally the size of my head a huge dollop of butter and syrup 3 pieces of crispy bacon and a soda all for only around 12 bucks
now i do have a small gripe about this place but it isn't enough to ever get me to stop coming
the booths and tables are a bit small so if you have a bigger group you may end up being a bit uncomfortable even in a big booth
other than that i absolutely love peppermill and will be returning
if you went to pho so 1 and wondered why it's shit all of sudden its because their old staff and previous owner is now at viet noodle bar
man what can i say about this this shit is always fucking lit man
their pho is brilliant and the egg rolls are fucking sex man
excellent sushi fabulous salad and soup
peaceful atmosphere
will definitely be back
this place is a gem i have passed it a million times finally decided to try it
i went for the buffet after reading some of the reviews following the gastronomically sage advice of misty y
d she has not steered me wrong yet
upon arrival we were greeted by roberto who graciously informed us that we were just in time to still partake in the buffet happy hour special
lol which includes the drinks in the price of the already reasonably priced buffet available from 11 12
there are a great number of delectable choices here i wanted everything first off i had some pizza the sicilian sandwich some broasted chicken which i am a sucker for and which i probably haven't had since i lived worked in kuwait one year
why aren't there more broasted chicken places anyways
round 2 was corn chowder pasta
the corn chowder was a little too sweet for my liking but it was tasty
the pasta was very good for a buffet
i finished off the buffet with a slice of apple pizza the cinnamon buns
alas i may have found a new pizza buffet spot i feel that i will become a graziano's regular who knows i may even try out the monster pizza challenge some day
stay tuned
what a great extension of the fremont street experience vegas's own little hipsterville
the old school barbershop screams hipster
chic boutiques housed in shipping containers create a voyeuresque look
very modern and clean
the containers are architecturally interesting structures to wander through it's fun for kids and adults
there are rad outdoor sculptures that include a huge praying mantis
it's a beautifully lit outdoor space for enjoying a different type of vegas entertainment
everyone is welcome in casual clothes or dressed up
it's family and kid friendly
kudos to the designers of the container park
food trucks hang out and offer tasty affordable vegas food
forget the strip this is more my style
i'm happy to hang out and spend my here
a co worker of mine looked at me and said that he felt a cold coming on
i knew i had the perfect treatment
ramen tatsu for lunch specifically the spicy miso ramen for him
we went to one of my favorite ramen spots
in my opinion this is some of the best ramen you can find here in las vegas
this hidden gem is a small shop nestled between two other shops
we were greeted by a smile by the super friendly server we were used to seeing
sit anywhere you'd like she said with a big smile
we sat at a table where she promptly took our drink orders
we ordered the spicy miso ramen miso ramen a large fried rice minus the pork and a house salad
as always the food did not disappoint
if i could buy a bottle of the dressing they use on their house salad i would
the spicy miso ramen had my co worker sweating it out while i enjoyed my pork free fried rice and salad
everything was so full of flavor
the service here is always perfect
lots of smiles very attentive and the food is always served quickly
i highly recommend this ramen shop
don't let the location of old las vegas fool you this place rocks on arrival i was given a rose
it is a very romatic setting and the decor is old school vegas which i love
the drinks were stiff and service was great victor rolled the salad cart over and prepared a custom salad which i was sad i had to stop eating so i wouldnt be full for the main course
the entrees were of generous porportions
my honey's piece of delicous salmon was huge at the end of the meal they brought complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries and other fruit with whipped cream
as i was sitting there i was already planning the next special occassion excuse so we can enjoy an awesome meal there
came here on super bowl sunday and it was not busy at all fast service fresh quality
heard they're the same owners as sakana which used to be my favorite ayce spot
will be back again
i've been going to this place for 9 years
i've followed them from new location to location for three reasons really 1 the service is always exceptional the chefs are funny quick and create an amazing experience
2 i have never eaten better sushi it may be pricy at times but it is soooo worth it 3
the vibe in these restaurants is super awesome enjoy you won't ever turn back
the thought of the food we ate there still has me drooling
one of the best buffets in vegas
this place is fun to go to with a big group of people
neat sights to see in restaurant great sushi the best fried rice our waitress was the best the cook we had was funny and talented
our group of 7 all had a great time
first time there and had a great time
this place is like the show cheers you are welcomed and feel at home
karaoke is fun and nobody cares if you sing good or not love the onion rings
downside is that drinks food take awhile
fun hang out place after work
i usually come here for some drinks and laughter with some friends
they bartenders and waiters are super funny
love their happy hour and their mixed soju's
that combination creeps up on you
the food here is delicious my friend and i came here for my first time and his second time today and we ate so much everything on the menu sounded so good we couldn't decide what to eat so we got everything we got
the meltdown fantastic filling sandwich with perfectly cooked meat and tons of cheese melted together
the bread was also perfectly buttered and grilled to crunchy perfection
came with tasty truffle fries
nice to greek you most delicious flatbread pizza i've had anywhere
there are so many flavors in this it's definitely a must try
cheezy peezy they aren't lying when they say this is cheesy
it was good although i wish we had out style meat on it to go with all the cheese
yummus your standard hummus appetizer
was good though the pita was a little to hard for my liking
bleu balsamic steak and bleu cheese perfection tender cooked beef and sweet tomatoes and red onions to go with made this one of the favorites
black cherry soda get it it tastes like a slurpee but better this pace is amazing i can't believe it took me so long to come here
i'll be here all the time now
the best burger i've ever had
the onion rings and truffle french fries are to die for
and the staff was super friendly
benn coming here since the 90's never have had a bad sub
for steaks i order a 4 always great
for breakfast you can't beat their bacon egg hoagie
sooooooooo good
delicious and great service very clean and cute restaurant and diverse menu
sad i haven't tried it sooner will be back
i had the omelette and home fries
i normally get hash browns but i am glad i chose the home fries
they were all the perfect texture and seasoned well
mr
mama was greeting customers at the door and his commentary added to the great atmosphere
very friendly nice customer service
everyone welcomed us with a soho we were able to come during the happy hour and ordered a lot off that menu
the fish was very fresh and flavorful
i would recommend the sunny salmon roll and truffle tempura
those were my two favorites
we ordered a lot of zesty items like the carpaccio and the mixed seafood tostada which was also tasty
overall a very pleasant experience deserving of 5 5 stars
i've had tapas in san sebastion and madrid but none as good as these
this place is as good as it gets in every respect
i am a carnivore i eat meat lol so my new boss recommends this restaurant to me and says they have great steaks and he was right
n9ne steakhouse is absolutely great i had the 22 oz porterhouse and the gf had the surf and turf
we also had the lobster mashed potatoes as our side dish
my steak was cooked perfectly medium rare charred on the outside and pink with a little red all the way through her surf and turf was a filet mignon with a lobster tail on top which tasted great
the lobster mashed is rich and creamy and full of lobster a must try all in all we had 2 drinks 2 entrees and 1 side and the bill came out to approx 160 not including tip
not bad a bit pricey but what do you expect from vegas great food will definitely return again and again
buen serivicio y rapido
pollo con mucho sabor y a buen precio
las asada fries tambien estan muy ricas
sin duda regresare muchas veces mas
the best buffet in vegas don't agree check it out for yourself and you can thank me later
food
i'm not a fan of buffets except for the ones in vegas
my favorite buffet before i went to bacchanal was wynn's the buffet
i thought that one was delicious still is but bacchanal takes the cake on this feud
where to begin
i guess i'll start from end to end
starting from the very right side of the buffet there is a huge display of asian food of all types
chinese food includes a variety of stuff like honey walnut shrimp beef and broccoli fried rice you name it
next there's a ton of dim sum options to choose from like steamed pork bun shrimp dumpling pork shumai and more
there's congee available with all the fix ins and miso soup
there's also fresh sushi and rolls available
my favorite is the salmon and the california rolls with fresh tuna and salmon sashimi on top
also there's a section just for olives
fancy
there's an italian section with a variety of pizzas on one side and then pasta on the other side
i realllllly liked their pasta carbonara
they also have a fresh juice section where they have pineapple guava mango juice and horchata bottled for you to enjoy
the american food section has sliders hot dogs mac and cheese fries sweet potato tater tots mashed potatoes variety of veggies prime rib brisket ribs you name it
the selection is huge
then there's the cold seafood section with crab shrimp oysters everything
my favorite part of this buffet is their dessert section they have a crepe maker one time i downed three of these in one visit
0 shame here
they also have mochi ice cream in just about every flavor gelato cheesecake pops cake pops brownies cookies cakes and more
they offer gluten free and low fat options too but don't get those
if you're dieting don't come to a buffet
service
i haven't always had the best service here but on my most recent visit i received excellent service by a filipino man who was our waiter he refilled our drinks constantly and took away our plates
he was kind and extremely quick to do things which i really appreciated
price
about 50 60 a person
typical for a vegas buffet
rest assured this place is definitely worth the money as long as you come hungry it's not a vegas trip unless i come here
until i find a buffet better than this one unlikely i'll be coming here every time i'm in town
it's all about the sear
and blt has done it to perfection
the rib eye is a 22 oz monster and is seared to perfection on all sides leaving a soft tender and juicy core
be warned it is enormous so save some space in your belly
hold off on the tempting popover they serve you with butter and sea salt
yes it is delicious but space consuming in your stomach
your steak deserves all the attention you can provide
don't bother with the sauces they provide you with a bone marrow and roasted garlic
it's all the flavor you need
scoop some of that gooey heaven from the bone core and smear it on your steak
or dredge your steak piece in the buttery pan they serve it in that is coated with bone marrow garlic goodness
perfection
don't make the mistake i did
start eating from the bone in
it's the most tender and flavorful
because once you get to eating around 75 your belly will reach its max
don't leave the best part on your plate
steak and red wine is all you need
time to get behind the felt now and throw some dice
thank god i saw a travel channel episode recommending dining at therapy
we ordered several items one at a time with the intention of going tapas style
we started with the empanada trio and it was a hit with our group
our favorite was the chorizo empanadas
next we ordered the buttermilk chicken breast on a red velvet waffle
that was very difficult to share
i really wanted to eat the entire thing myself especially because the cole slaw topping was one of the best i've ever had
next came the big sexy burger
we ordered it medium well and it was perfectly cooked
the aioli gave it such a creamy texture that we all finished up licking our fingers
this was truly a memorable dining experience in a city full of mediocre buffets and overpriced food network chef restaurants
please do yourself a favor and check out therapy
came here early on a friday night and it was very cozy and welcoming the service was amazing
it wasn't too busy yet although when we left around 6 30 it was starting to get kind of busy
i got the truffle fries and the amethyst cocktail
both were very good and the cocktail was very strong would recommend coming here during the less busy hours and the bar seating is just as nice as the regular
if you want to really taste everything this vegas buffet has to offer i suggest you go 30 min before brunch breakfast is going to end
dinner items are seamlessly swapped out and you get to enjoy all options
also add the 15 unlimited drinks pp
you get choices of beer champagne bloody mary's or mimosas
this is one of the best vegas buffets because of the variety of unique dishes they serve
mr w and i came to conquer and like my teen says we slay'd it a total 5 star for the wicked experience and service
had a great experience
workers were very helpful and friendly
totally recommend just try to find a seat during lunch tho
good hawaiian food with friendly service and enormous portions
i got the bbq combo plate with beef short ribs and i substituted the bbq chicken with chicken katsu curry
the meal was huge and everything was cooked well
after living in hawaii for close to four years this place brought back memories of all of the good local food you used to eat back in the day
i wish they served meat jun though
really good pizza why do i like their pizza 1
thin crust 2
great price on the strip
all of their speciality pizzas are priced at 12
3
perfect size for two people at 11 4
i came here both times and all of the service staff were uber friendly and served me with aloha 5
pizza took less than 10 minutes to arrive
6
plentiful toppings and flavor was excelllent
my gripes 1
no alcohol
not a big deal as there is a fat tuesday in the adjacent shop
2
they close too early for me i wished they stayed open until 4am or so
i am starting to like mgm grand and will probably stay there if not at the cosmo and if i do i expect multiple visits to this pizzeria
this place was great i had my birthday here and me and my friends loved it our waiter josh was excellent the place was clean and the food was delicious
this is by far my favorite vegas buffet
if you are looking for a cheap buffet this isn't for you but if you love good food and don't mind paying a bit extra there is no better place
the only place that had comparable quality and flavor is the wynn but i think bacchanal has more options and a better atmosphere
the bacchanal's dessert bar is to die for and they are always changing up their options
i usually like to go for a late lunch to get the better price and so i'm not too full when i go to bed
gem of the riviera for sure stopped in for happy hour
pinot grigio is not on the menu but they still served it to me at 5 a glass
i had to take my fries to go eventually you can really taste the truffle oil great size portions can't complain at all i suggest the parmesan truffle fries or caprese skewers i had a great bartender too left a 3 tip on a 10 bill
awesomeeee food pineapple fried rice is the best ive had
all their plates r wonderful and great service
id rather spend 50 here than anywhere else n know that the food is always perfect
keep up the amazing cuisine chef aloha
absolutely love the broth here
the broth has a very clean non fatty taste which i love egg rolls are tasty and the the pho is wonderful i usually go to jennipho but since this location is closer to my house ill frequent here now
i do wish they had an option where i could build my own pho
we are visiting for a few days and heard the story of the owner of eat very inspirational came here for lunch yesterday and cannot say enough good things about the vegetarian tofu banh mi sandwich and their iced tea
everything tastes fresh and carefully prepared
the wait was long for a large party of 6 but once seated service was super friendly
we stopped in for a drink and a snack while shopping
we sat at the bar and were acknowledged quickly
the music was great but not too loud
the place is clean and they even have a sink in the middle of the restaurant to wash your hands after staff was pleasant and attentive offering options and recommendations
the wings in the chilli sauce were amazing as were the fries
next time i want to try an adult milkshake
brandon the gm was great
came yesterday for dinner
decided to come again today with more friends
tried more dishes
delicious food we will come again next year when we are in town
this is a seriously beautifully decorated oozing of a confident and visually stunning yet subtle interior piece of a restaurant
it looks better in person than in the pictures
could have gone both ways corny and tired a visual concept or simply gorgeous
my judgment goes to the latter
the quality of materials used constructing this place is above and beyond execution was everything
the ambiance is absolutely stunning
the service was impeccable and i mean impeccable
the food was good
one of my favorites
we came upon this diner while driving around site seeing on our vacation
our waitress christy was so nice we talked and joked oround with her throughout our dinner
she was very attentive we never asked for refills since she brought refills before we could ask
all the staff were very friendly
two other staff came over to asked how our food was
the food wow huge portions and so delicious we didnt want to stop eating even when we were full needless to say we most definitely will be going back for more the prices are very reasonable well worth it
i don't know how they make money since the portions a so huge highly urge you to try this delish diner enjoy
service good
food quality fair
up charged me on the bill
with all the restaurants there are many better opportunities pricewise food quality
my experiences have all been excellent
thanks to all the hard working staff
the lamb chops chopped salad are my favorites
best mexican food we've had in a while
manny was excellent
he was on point even though he was very busy
game 7 nba we never run out of chips or drinks sarah was sweet and personable
stephen the manager also has a great personal and was constantly walking the floor
great food and service
will need to come back here again everything looked so good
i wanted to order the whole left side of the menu
great place for lunch
yet to try breakfast
lovely owners didn't charge extra for a new melon tea when i split it open all over the table
we attended a private dinner party hosted by our friends last night
we have never been here before
on walking in we were warmly greeted by a hostess and was instructed to wait in the bar until the party organizer arrives to approve the setup
since this was to be a surprise bday for her boyfriend we thought this was a bit strange
after clearing things up w the mgr we were promptly escorted into a private dining room next to the wine cellar
the room was arranged beautifully
all the chairs were covered in white seat covers w a gold sash
the dinnerware and glass stemware were arranged perfectly
our wait person tiana came in all smile and welcomed all of us
she gave us a brief overview of the night and proceeded to take our cocktail orders
everyone enjoyed their cocktail and admired the vast wine collection in the cellar through a floor to ceiling glass wall
once the guest of honor arrived the party started
we dined on appetizers of shrimp cocktail 3 ways philly cheese egg rolls and crab cakes
the menu selection had 3 types of salads 7 different meats from steak to fish to chicken
then there are 3 sides and 2 options for dessert
i andorra of the attendees had the prime ribeye or filet mignon and they were cooked perfectly
red center and pink on the outside
the salmon was cooked medium which is more done then i prefer but they do ask you for your preference so i would not ding em for that
however is ding their salad offerings
when you state your house salad is a mixed green you shouldn't be offering iceberg with a few sliver of carrots croutons
that's and iceberg lettuce salad not mixed greens
it was awful
but it's either that or cesar salad or a blue cheese wedge salad
our drinks were always full and tiana and the rest of the team were fantastic
to finish off our dinner we enjoyed a special birthday cake them tiana took us inside the wine cellar to admire their collections
then she showed us the 007 james bond table which was awesome
you'll have to ask to se that whenever you're there
we'll definitely be back
i believe bachannel buffet is one of the best buffets in vegas excellent food and great drinks
awesome rib eye for 2 steak aged 90 days approx 38 ounces and at least 24 ounces of eatable aged meat very tasty also excellent sides
huge wine list
le petit bakery but saveur immense
this amazing isn't very close to home for me but i'll definitely make the trip back soon
the shop is located near 215 sunset in a corporate area
there is plenty of parking and the location is easy to access
the inside of the shop is very cute with a large couch and cute tables
it's obvious that care was given in the details of the decorating and design of the shop
i really enjoyed the ambiance
the staff was welcoming and friendly
that definitely added to the warm fuzzy feeling of the dining experience
bethany e
found this cute bakery and we made plans to meet up for a saturday lunch
what a lunch it was we like to order several items and share so that we can try a variety of items
croque madame like a croque monsieur but with a fried egg on top and served with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe
the amount of flavor in this was amazing
the bread was tasty and the ham had a nice flavor and crisp to it i'm not normally even big on ham
the cheese on this dish really made the overall flavor pop
loved this item
quiche lorraine a modest slice of quiche with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe
the quiche had a lovely richness to it and a perfectly flaky crust
i also loved this dish
apple cinnamon caramel sugar crepe this was one of the larger items that we ordered
good thing since it tasted amazing
the crepe was perfectly light and delicious
the caramel and green apple inside were perfection with the delicious crepe
i absolutely recommend this item as well
lavender cake this was really packed with lavender
i enjoy lavender treats but this was a little heavy on the lavender for me
the cake itself was moist and the frosting on the cake was tasty too
raspberry macaron perfect flavor and texture
i enjoyed this and would love to try more flavors in the future
salted caramel cupcake a stand out for sure
we decided that anything with caramel here is going to be the best
this was the type of dessert that stops you in your tracks with its incredible flavor
chocolate cupcake very good with a nice moist cake and a frosting that tasted like it had a hint of mocha
salted caramel cookie one of my favorites of the desserts we tried
it had a bit of chewiness with a slight crisp
the caramel really made this dessert amazing
i'll definitely be back for more delicious treats
i've been wanting to try this place forever because the burgers and shakes look incredible
however i go there and what do i get the soft shell crab bruschetta and a maui coconut porter beer
however i do not regret my choices
both were absolutely incredible my dad had sliders fries and the root beer float and he said it was great
and my sister had the urth sliders vegan patties with the s'mores milkshake
and she loved hers
and the service might have been the absolute best i've ever had anywhere our server's name was robin and she was spectacular very friendly very good at her job
i definitely will be going back there soon for a buger and fries and i will be asking for robin again great place
came here on a thursday night during a rush and were seated on the patio our preference within 10 minutes
we had the pleasure of having danny as our sever he was fabulous attentive fun and charming
do yourself a favor come here and enjoy a delicious margarita and live music
if you have only one night in vegas and or can only afford to indulge in a nice meal at one restaurant this is the place you must go for dinner
go for broke and get the pasta tasting menu with the wine pairing
yes it's pricey but it is worth every penny
your taste buds will love you
i honestly can't say anything about the menu beyond the pasta dishes as that is all i ever have when i dine here
with pasta this incredibly good i have no desire to try anything else on the menu
i have come to firmly believe that there is nothing better that will ever pass my lips than the beef cheek ravioli here at b b
i am salivating just typing this
it is literally the single best thing i have ever eaten
and i've always experienced great service here
i've even been the last patron in the place and didn't feel even a tiny bit rushed
kim and raju was so awesome
just flew into vegas from nyc and was a bit tired
but they definitely brought life to our table
what a awesome first experience
thank you guys
i've been here 2 days in a row first its super close to our house
it's kind of hard to see since i'm super blind but it's right next to albertsons
when i go to ca i always go to 87 degrees and get their jasmine tea with sea salt cream
after finding this place i don't think i'm going to ca anytime soon
thank you for bringing sea salt cream to lv staff are super nice they make you feel like you're at home
my boyfriend got the cantaloupe green tea and it was refreshing good do yourself a favor and try this place
ordered the mexican pizza and wings
didn't know what to expect but it was delicious
takes about 45 min for your order but worth the wait
my wings were hot and crispy
that sauce is amazing
definitely going back
got chicken pad thai to go so i could eat something while smoking hookah at madhouse
all i gotta say it's a super cute place and the pad thai was good
i think it was made with pho noodles but it's still yummy nonetheless
mine was a level 7 spicy and the flavors made up for the difference in noodle texture
would definitely go back to try other dishes
sandwiches at this place are amazing we come all the way from california to get them
even grab some on the drive home
enjoy
excellent burgers is a family favorite
one of the few places that i can take my picky teens two and both love the food
the staff is wonderful and service is always good
ignore the low raters they are haters
you will love this place
totally stumbled upon this place by accident
and what a fortunate accident it was
the watermelon mojito was refreshing as it was delicious
i was torn on what to order but our server helped with narrowing down the decisions
pear best salad chorizo plate and the mushroom pastry were more than enough to satisfy
the location is close enough to the strip to make it an easy enough venture but far enough away from all the noise and hustle n bustle
loved the outside patio seating that provided plenty of shade and cooling fans with mist
i definitely need to come back again
with more friends and a bigger appetite
the dessert menu is calling my name
always a line must be good i always get the almond milk tea and it's yummy
love that they have crepes as well
me and my wife for a dinner sunday night and the pizza was very very good i liked it so much so i'll come with my family and friends next time
food is very delicious their tacos and carne asada quesadilla were really good the staff is very friendly
it's good for a quick bite
from start to finish my expectations were met and exceeded
we shared with a calamari appetizer very fresh and perfectly fried with a delicious marinara dipping sauce
the portion was very large
i had oso bucco and my guest had chicken piccata
both dishes we're among the best we've had
the room which was full yet was blessedly quiet we could actually carry on a conversation
the service was attentive
delicious food beautifully served in an elegant room
perfect
i am a huge fan of taco bell in general their food is always so delicious and innovative as well as incredibly affordable i got their new chicken nachos
though i was admittedly hesitant i actually thoroughly enjoyed them especially with their yummy nacho cheese dip
i always add in hot sauce to their cheese to add a bit of spice
i got their 5 cravings deal which is honestly such a steal including a burrito gordita taco nachos and a drink i also got a pepsi slushie not with alcohol which was amazing especially amidst the vegas heat
everything was so good but what really makes this taco bell is the environment
with the dj upstairs the fun decor the shining lights the aura was amazing
it is definitely a place where you can jam to and just have a ton of fun without having to be 21 or having to be drunk
this is the place to go in vegas in my opinion
also the dj that was there when i went was absolutely killing the game
simply stated the food here was absolutely delicious the food is very savory and the staff is incredibly pleasant
it was a pleasure to dine here and i look forward to future visits
i don't usually write reviews but this place is totally worth it the food is amazing i can't imagine ordering pizza from anywhere else after trying this awesome place
not only is the food good the customer service was excellent they're always so friendly and helpful i definitely recommend this to anybody that's searching for a new pizza place
from the minute that you're greeted at the door until you pay your bill you'll be treated like royalty
the first time that i walked into forte the owner nina came over to introduce herself and tell us about her menu
now years later nina still is the same fun gracious owner that she was in the early days
and the food it really doesn't matter what you order it will be outstanding you know how some restaurants lose quality over time not forte they just keep getting better and better
diners drive ins and dives guy fieri did a segment about forte
he couldn't say enough great things about forte and they are all true
in fact i believe that nina and her father stephan were the only people to ever punk guy
it was hilarious
anyway nina and forte get my highest praise for food quality and atmosphere
give it a try you won't be sorry
just come hungry
being from new jersey and a huge yankees fan this place is soo good
felt like i was back on the west coast
good prices and even better pizza i'll definitely be back glad i found this gem
a good environment and the yankee memorabilia is so bomb
shout out to bryce
he is always animated and energetic
my kids recognize him every time we come and he always goes out of his way to say hi and make them feel special
he's just a good kid
we love seeing his happy smiling face keep up the good work bryce
i come here often and i love it
good food good prices
it's pretty authentic and you get a lot for what you pay
the service is always great
get the guacamole
always delicious
must try truffle mac and cheese chorizo meatballs and creamed spinach
drink are also amazing
let them surprise you with a drink
always good
atmosphere also very nice
one of my favorite spots
this is the place to get your raw meat
steaks ribs chicken or hot links
this place is amazing
call in your order they have it ready when you need it usually next day for me
